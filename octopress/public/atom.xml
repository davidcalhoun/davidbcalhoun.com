    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back I had a need for a general timeout option for async.parallel and was surprised I couldn’t find much information about how to do it.  I was using async.parallel to make a lot of REST calls in parallel, but one of them was getting blocked by a firewall, resulting in an eventual timeout minutes later.</p>

<p>One option was to specify a shorter timeout for each individual REST call, including the one causing the problem.  But I wanted a simpler solution: a general timeout for that specific async.parallel instance that made it clear all tasks should finish within a certain period of time. Otherwise return a timeout as an error, allowing the program to continue (and retry if necessary).</p>

<p>It was somewhat surprising there wasn’t an option built into async.parallel, as I could imagine other folks must have had the same problem at some point in time.</p>

<p>In any case, I wrote a pretty simple wrapper function that gets the job done (see example usage below):</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/franksvalli/15026495731/"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/milky-way-galaxyrise-from-maui-hawaii.jpg" alt="Milky Way galaxyrise from Maui (at the Mauian hotel)" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>

<p>I was lucky enough to finally visit Hawaii with my parents.  Being experts Hawaii tourists, they set us up in a nice traditional resort called The Mauian - a nice quiet(er) little place that has a time for “quiet hours” (apparently the other resorts are places to party).</p>

<p>We got back to the hotel a little after quiet hours, and my folks mentioned that you could see the Milky Way quite clearly.  Being Hawaii, and Maui at that, there wasn’t a lot of light pollution like we’re used to.  I thought I better not miss the chance, and went and grabbed my 16-35mm f/2.8.</p>

<p>I didn’t bring any sort of a tripod on this trip, so I grabbed my spare pants and rolled them up a bit, then rested the camera on them.  Not too bad, actually.</p>

<p>The final settings: 16mm f/2.8, 4 seconds @ ISO 6400.  I was also sure to move to manual focus and set the focus at the sweet-spot (live view helps a bit here).</p>

<p>There was surprisingly little post-processing.  I added the usual tweaks to highlights and shadows and adjusted the black and white levels very slightly.  Added a bit of clarity and a bit of vibrance to bring out the colors.  This was at ISO 6400, so I added some noise reduction combined with some sharpening.</p>

<p>Recently I have been lusting after a nicer astrophotography lens, the 24mm f/1.4, but this photo I took with my existing gear mostly proved to me that I can make do with what I have.  Also, location matters the most.  You can’t get these kinds of shots from where I live without driving hundreds and hundreds of miles away.</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-30T11:59:21-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Over the years there’s been a steadily increasing ecosystem of JavaScript components to choose from.  The sheer amount of choices is fantastic, but this also infamously presents a difficulty when components are mixed-and-matched.  And it doesn’t take too long for budding developers to find out that not all components are built to play nicely together.</p>

<p>To address these issues, the competing module specs AMD and CommonJS have appeared on the scene, allowing developers to write their code in an agreed-upon sandboxed and modularized way, so as not to “pollute the ecosystem”.</p>

<h3 id="amd">AMD</h3>
<p>Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) has gained traction on the frontend, with RequireJS being the most popular implementation.</p>

<p>Here’s module <code>foo</code> with a single dependency on <code>jquery</code>:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
<a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a>
<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">//    filename: foo.js</span>
define([<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">jquery</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>], <span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="predefined">$</span>) {
    <span class="comment">//    methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">myFunc</span>(){};

    <span class="comment">//    exposed public methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> myFunc;
});
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>And a little more complicated example with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
<a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a>
<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
<a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a>
<strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong>
<a href="#n11" name="n11">11</a>
<a href="#n12" name="n12">12</a>
<a href="#n13" name="n13">13</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">//    filename: foo.js</span>
define([<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">jquery</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">underscore</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>], <span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="predefined">$</span>, _) {
    <span class="comment">//    methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">a</span>(){};    <span class="comment">//    private because it's not returned (see below)</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">b</span>(){};    <span class="comment">//    public because it's returned</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">c</span>(){};    <span class="comment">//    public because it's returned</span>

    <span class="comment">//    exposed public methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> {
        <span class="key">b</span>: b,
        <span class="key">c</span>: c
    }
});
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>The first part of the define is an array of dependencies, while the second part is essentially the callback function which is only executed when the dependencies are available (script loaders like RequireJS take care of that part, including figuring out where the files are located).</p>

<p>Note that the dependency to variable order is important (ex. jquery-&gt;<code>$</code>, underscore-&gt;<code>_</code>).</p>

<p>Also note that we can map the dependencies to any arbitrary variables we want here.  If we change <code>$</code> to <code>$$</code> in the code above, all jQuery references within our function block will be <code>$$</code> instead of <code>$</code>.</p>

<p>And note, most importantly, that you can’t reference the variables <code>$</code> and <code>_</code> outside of the function, because it’s sandboxed from other code.  That’s the goal here!</p>

<h3 id="commonjs">CommonJS</h3>

<p>CommonJS is a style you may be familiar with if you’re written anything in Node (which uses a slight variant).  It’s also been gaining traction on the frontend with Browserify.</p>

<p>Using the same format as before, here’s what our <code>foo</code> module looks like in CommonJS:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>

<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
<a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a>
<strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">//    filename: foo.js</span>

<span class="comment">//    dependencies</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="predefined">$</span> = require(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">jquery</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);

<span class="comment">//    methods</span>
<span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">myFunc</span>(){};

<span class="comment">//    exposed public method (single)</span>
module.exports = myFunc;
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>And our more complicate example, with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>

};

<h3 id="umd-universal-module-definition">UMD: Universal Module Definition</h3>

<p>Since CommonJS and AMD styles have both been equally popular, it seems there’s yet no consensus.  This has brought about the push for a “universal” pattern that supports both styles, which brings us to none other than the Universal Module Definition.</p>

<p>The pattern is admittedly ugly, but is both AMD and CommonJS compatible, as well as supporting the old-style “global” variable definition:</p>

<p><em>(Banner: would you like to download the app?)</em></p>

<p>The mobile web remains dead.</p>

<p><em>(Splash screen: download the app!)</em></p>

<p>And <strong>we</strong> have killed it.</p>

<p><em>(JavaScript prompt: “Yahoo! can serve you more accurate local weather and news if you enable location services”)</em></p>

<p>Yet its shadow still looms.</p>

<p><em>(Prompt: Yahoo! would like to use your Current Location)</em></p>

<p>How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?</p>

<p><em>(“Do you want to change your search engine to Yahoo?”)</em></p>

<p><em>(“This forum has an app for iPhone and iPod Touch!  Click OK to learn more about Tapatalk.”)</em></p>

<p>(adapted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead">Nietzsche’s “God is dead”</a>)</p>

<h3 id="download-the-app-is-king-content-is-secondary">“Download the app” is king; content is secondary</h3>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ChristianHeilmann/posts/Tkpqip4uZpB"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/paul-irish-native-apps-eating-our-lunch.png" /></a></p>

<p>What you tried to read above was not entirely different from my once-a-year curiosity visit to Yahoo’s mobile homepage (ok, minus the jab at the much-hated Tapatalk).  During the course of one visit and one search, those really are all the prompts which got in the way of what I was trying to accomplish on the site.</p>

<p>While I’d love to pick on Yahoo in particular, mobile users know this common experience all too well.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that the primary content of many mobile sites is now a big giant “Download the app here” button.  How strange that we find ourseles in a world where the secondary content is that which the user is actually interested in.</p>

<h3 id="native-vs-web">Native vs. Web</h3>
<p>Like most things, we humans like to create dichotomies, and we did the same with native and web, persistently thinking them to be mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>For a short time, it seemed, contrary to mobile platforms that came before, that the revolutionary smartphone of 2007 would have developers creating a flurry of web apps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps <em>that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone</em>. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services. They can make a call, they can send an email, they can look up a location on Google Maps. And guess what? There’s no SDK that you need! You’ve got everything you need if you know how to write apps using the most modern web standards to write amazing apps for the iPhone today. So developers, we think we’ve got a very sweet story for you. You can begin building your iPhone apps today. (<a href="http://youtu.be/8Vq993Td6ys?t=37s">Steve Jobs at WWDC 2007</a>, emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, even in that keynote you can see shades of web apps being pitted against native apps.  And what would both developers and consumers rather have: an emulated native experience, or a true native experience?  Most folks have always wanted the latter, and the latter has consistently delivered a better user experience.</p>

<p>Very talented developers have created “native-like” experiences on the web, including the old iPhone user guide (powered by <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2009/pastrykit-digging-into-an-apple-pie/">PastryKit</a>), but all along it’s been native apps which have required less effort and less clever tricks for smooth user interfaces.  However, this being said, it should also be noted that many native apps today actually have a web view component, and end users are often unaware of this fact.</p>

<p>In 2007, after the release of the first iPhone, the web app vision was soon abandoned after a somewhat lackluster and uncoordinated response from us developers.  Apple also realized the monetary potential of native apps and a wildly successful centralized App Store, a path that’s led us to our current situation:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/109749/Apps-Solidify-Leadership-Six-Years-into-the-Mobile-Revolution"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/apps-dominate.jpg" alt="Apps Continue to Dominate the Mobile Web: 2013 saw 80% of time spent in apps and 20% of time on the mobile web, whereas 2014 is currently seeing 86% app usage and 14% mobile web usage." /></a></p>

<h3 id="keep-calm-and-carry-on-">Keep Calm and Carry On… ?</h3>
<p>The web isn’t going away anytime soon, and that means the mobile web is also here to stay, even if less people are using it.  But it unfortunately means less emphasis on mobile experiences, which means less demand for mobile web developers.</p>

<p>It means that the mobile web, and probably the larger web as a whole, will only be considered as an afterthought, if considered at all.  We’ve already witnessed this happening with the mobile web being considered a sort of sub/side topic of responsive web design.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/negative-scroll-blur.html">Demo</a></p>

<p>Just for fun, I wanted to reproduce a cool but completely superfluous UI I saw in the updated Foursquare app recently. Basically, when the user tries to scroll past the upper bound of the app/page, the header image becomes blurred.</p>

<p>We can do the same thing on the web by listening for negative scroll and then using (abusing?) CSS filters.</p>

<h3 id="extra-tweaks-for-mobile">Extra tweaks for mobile</h3>

<p>Note that there’s an extra trick for iOS, which presents problems I had forgotten about (namely, no negative scroll, and a scroll listener which fires once at the end of scrolling). That’s why I had to throw in some extra logic for touchstart/touchmove/touchend.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="explanation-1">Explanation</h4>

<p>Again, no sanitization needed here because i is guaranteed to be an integer. The solution relies on an understanding of the modulus function - this is something usually learned in school, but something I haven’t had to use since, except in interviews or quizzes. Or quizzes during interviews.</p>

<p>Basically, think of modulus as “remainder” function for division problems. For instance, <code>4 % 2</code> will give a modulus of <code>1</code> because 4 goes into 2 twice, evenly, with zero remainder. On the other hand, <code>5 % 2</code> will give a modulus of <code>1</code> because 5 goes into 2 twice, with a remainder of 1. This turns out to be a handy way to differentiate even (4) and odd (5) numbers.</p>

<p>(note that the <code>else</code> isn’t needed here, but it gives greater clarity to what’s going on)</p>

    }
}
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<h4 id="explanation-2">Explanation</h4>

<p>Now we’re getting a bit tougher!</p>

<p>Strings have a handy function that splits them into an array: <code>split()</code>. For instance,</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">foo.bar.baz</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>.split(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">.</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>)
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>will output</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>[<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">foo</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">bar</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">baz</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>]
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Notice that the periods have been removed, just as the prompt asked for!</p>

<p>In this case we need to first check if there was no file extension. This means that there were no periods to split on, resulting in a one-member array (<code>"foo".split(".")</code> becomes <code>["foo"]</code>). In this case we return <code>false</code>, as the prompt asks for.</p>

<p>Now, in the else case, we know that the array must be larger than 1, meaning that it has a file extension. Since the file extension is always at the end, we know that it must be the last member in the array.</p>

<p>We can find the index of the last member by taking into account array length (<code>filenameArray.length</code>) and the fact that the array is zero-indexed, meaning that we need to subtract 1 from this length. Now we know the extension exists and is at the end of the array, so all we need to do is return it:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">return</span> filenameArray[filenameArray.length - <span class="integer">1</span>];

<h4 id="explanation-3">Explanation</h4>

<p>This is a pretty classic interview question. It’s fairly easy and straightforward: just keep track of the longest string in a variable, then loop through all the members of the array. If the current member is longer, set it as the new longest string. At the end, return whatever that variable contains.</p>

<p>Note the extra sanitization check here to make sure the type is a string. If it’s not a string, we <code>continue</code> to continue to the next iteration of the <code>for</code> loop. (Note that this is similar to returning early in functions)</p>

<h4 id="explanation-4">Explanation</h4>

<p>The best way to handle this one is through recursion, which is tricky but powerful. I admit that on my first attempts writing it in the console, my browser froze up and I had to restart it.</p>

<p>Recursive functions are very elegant but tricky. It helps to step through with examples.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with <code>arraySum(1)</code>. The output is of course 1, but note that we didn’t actually input an array. The code took the first codepath in the <code>if</code> statement (because <code>typeof 1 === "number"</code> is true)</p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we input a basic array:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>arraySum([<span class="integer">1</span>]);  <span class="comment">// 1</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Again the answer is 1, but this time the codepath was different. This time <code>Array.isArray([1])</code> was true, and the function was called recursively for each of the members in the array. That is to say, each member of the array (in this case the single member) was sent to arraySum as a simple integer. So the recursive call was the same as the original example: <code>arraySum(1)</code>, and the output was the same.</p>

<p>In the case of more numbers, the outputs are all added to the <code>sum</code> and then returned back at the end of the function.</p>

<p>Note that this works quite well for even deeply nested arrays, since arraySum() has logic for arrays that will always return the sum of all of its deeply nested integers:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>arraySum([<span class="integer">1</span>, [<span class="integer">2</span>,[<span class="integer">3</span>,[<span class="integer">4</span>,[<span class="integer">5</span>]]]]]);   <span class="comment">// 15</span>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/the-google-bitch"/>
    <updated>2013-09-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/the-google-bitch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I came back from Japan and accepted an offer to work at a startup in Silicon Valley, I knew one of the biggest challenges would be to find a decent and affordable apartment in Mountain View, close to where I’d be working. I had it all planned out, and how healthy and convenient it would be to walk to work and also Mountain View downtown!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this dream was shared by me and hundreds of thousands of other like-minded software engineers. Which isn’t unexpected, really. If you spend enough time in Silicon Valley, everyone’s ideas start to sound the same after a while.</p>

<p>Mountain View, if you didn’t already know, is home to the now omnipresent non-evil company known as Google. Google has been fast taking over Mountain View, building by building, campus extension by campus extension. They even have their name on the sidewalks near where I take walks at work. Because they own those, too. (Actually, they own the fiber connections running beneath them).</p>

<p>One day I went out apartment hunting and was pretty happy the apartment listed earlier in the day hadn’t already sold, as had happened several times earlier (yes, there is THAT much competition).</p>

<p>As I drove up and approached the apartment, I noticed the unwelcoming stare of a single woman waiting outside the complex. She didn’t say anything, so I mentioned that she must be waiting for the apartment walk-through the same as myself. She acknowledged and then mentioned that “he was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago”, referring to the current tenant who was supposed to show up earlier for an apartment viewing.</p>

<p>I saw that she was pretty serious about maintaining that she was here first, and I cracked a joke about folks being cutthroat because of the competition or some such thing, to try to break the tension. I even said it with a smile, which is supposed to prompt at least a crack of a smile in any human capable of empathy. Sadly it had no effect on this poor emotionless woman. It was clear that she was all business.</p>

<p>It’s not dissimilar to the animal kingdom, really. She was just establishing her dominance by passively explaining that she was here before I was. Oh I see, so even if I wanted this place, I’d have no shot at it, because you were here first? I guess that’s what you have to do these days to ensure you get a place…</p>

<p>I hear it’s worse in “The City®” (San Francisco), and I’m not surprised really. The last time I was looking for apartments there, it was a crappy little studio apartment in a crappy part of town, with what looked like 20 people lined up ahead of me to put down a deposit. No thank you. Sometimes I think I’d rather live someplace in the country.</p>

<p>Alright, back to my apartment hunting story in Mountain View. I figured I might as well take a look at the place, since I’d taken the time to come by. Some other folks showed up and started waiting in the same spot, until finally the current tenant came by, apologized for the wait, and took us through the apartment.</p>

<p>To be honest, the apartment was nothing special. It was an older apartment that was part of a fourplex with families with kids on all sides. Not exactly a quiet place. Sure, there was nice lush greenery everywhere, and of course it was conveniently situated in Mountain View, but it was overall not exceptional. But in a bubble economy, the location is now sufficient to make anything special and worth the price.</p>

<p>I asked the current tenant about cable internet availability, and the single woman decided to use her God-given right to interrupt and respond: “The entire city of Mountain View has WiFi provided for free by Google”. Without missing a beat, she added some other talking points as if they were coming out of a pre-prepared handbook. It actually kind of sounded like someone reciting a memorized passage from the Bible. And there was a certain pride behind it, to give me a hint that I need not ask if she worked for the blasted company.</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to say other than, “Oh, that’s cool”. I really wasn’t prepared to deal with corporate shills on what had become an epic search for an apartment.</p>

<p>After looking around a bit more, I was the second to last person to talk to the owner and take an application. He was more than patient with me, but I noticed the very last person waiting in the shadows to talk to him was The Google Bitch. Dammit, so she had some scheme she was waiting to thrust on the poor guy.</p>

<p>As I walked away and went back to my car, still within earshot The Google Bitch made an offer to the guy: “So, I am prepared to put down money today to secure this apartment” she said confidently. The current tenant just said “Wow, ok” and they talked from there.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I never turned in the application, as it would’ve just been a waste of everyone’s time.</p>

<p>I have since settled into an apartment community in Sunnyvale, where I have been adopted by a very extended, loving Indian family. They sometimes give me funny looks when I walk through the complex, but it’s all good. Perhaps the farther from The Google Bitch and people like her, the better.</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/fourth-of-july-letter-to-my-government"/>
    <updated>2013-07-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/fourth-of-july-letter-to-my-government</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(this is a copy of a letter which I’ve sent to various representatives in government)</p>

<p>As a concerned citizen, I know you understand that I must occasionally voice my concern through letters such as this. My hope is that you will honestly consider my claims and take action on my part. I honestly appreciate you taking your time to seriously consider this letter.</p>

<p>I’m writing to you today specifically in response to abuses by the NSA overstepping its bounds. Citizens of the United States and citizens of the world now know its private data is being indiscriminately collected, sifted through, and intruded upon by the NSA. These actions are clearly antithetical to our own Constitution and set a terrible precedent for the future of this country and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Today is the Fourth of July. However, this Fourth of July is a bit different for me. Instead of setting off fireworks and spending time with my family, I am alone in Japan. Yet I am not alone in my concerns that my constitutional rights are being forced away from me.</p>

<p>As you well know, there are protests today in support of restoring the fourth amendment and against organizations such as the NSA which subvert our Constitution in the name of national security. I sincerely wish I could join these rallies, but I must show support by other means, such as through this letter. While I admit it would be interesting to protest the Japanese way, parked at a street intersection shouting my protests through a megaphone, it seems more effective for me to write directly to you. And to other people such as you who have the full time job of representing me and people like myself.</p>

<p>While the US has never been a perfect country, I know it’s had better times. I’m not the only one who believes our nation is now in a bad way. Yet I hope to do my small part to help fix some of these problems in my lifetime, in order to make America a better place for us all. Since we are both Americans, I hope we share this common interest.</p>

<p>My growing list of grievances is too much to list here, therefore I want to focus on recent revelations by whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden. This has been a tipping point for me and many fellow Americans, whom I hope have also been awoken from a dogmatic slumber.</p>

<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, as a result I’ve started to become more of a believer in America. Or rather, what America is intended to be. I’ve recently found myself reading more about the history of my country. I’ve become interested in politics, and for the first time in my life I’ve seriously considered joining a protest. I have become a better citizen in the hope for a better America.</p>

<p>President Obama and others in positions of power have defended these NSA spying programs, responding by explaining that they have come into effect through lawful means. Yet there has been massive public backlash, which I believe should at least warrant a reconsideration of these surveillance programs. I trust people like you to make sure this happens.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that this hasn’t been the first time in recent years the great disconnect between the governed and the government has been exposed. Perhaps our representatives are not really representing our interests after all? The situation isn’t dissimilar to what culminated in the breaking off and founding of our nation in the first place.</p>

<p>It will be a great shame, but perhaps we are part of the generation which collectively allowed the great American experiment to fail?</p>

<p>Update (July 12, 2013):</p>

<p>I received a reply from one of my senators, Diane Fienstein. While it’s a generic reply sent to everyone sending letters similar to my own (http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/nsa-programs), I appreciate some sort of response.</p>

<p>I’m still concerned however. Fienstein argued her case with the same defense as Obama: our repesentatives in the House and Senate voted these spying initiatives into law. Therefore it’s “legal” and was created and approved by people we voted into law.</p>

<p>This is supposed to dissuade my fears in some way, but it actually makes me more apprehensive. Where are the people in government that represent me and my fears? Where are the people in Congress to re-examine the work they’ve made of the Constitution?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The real shame about NSA/PRISM is that everyone will forget about it next week or next month. Just like we forgot about Trapwire and other endless abuses in the name of protecting society.</p>

<p>The US is now a nation too mentally castrated to do anything about these obvious constitutional abuses. Why are we only capable of short-lived and impotent protest attempts like Occupy? How did we get to be so sedated through this anesthesia of modern consumerism and entertainment?</p>

<p>As of today, it’s no longer just a thought confined to the head of some crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>UPDATE:<br />
Today <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22820711">President Obama defended the spy programs (cell phone and internet espionage)</a>, directly against <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6fnfVJzZT4">his campaign promises (video from 2007)</a>, in I suppose a true political fashion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Google</a> CEOs appeared to have denied involvement using carefully constructed statements. One of the commenter’s on Mark Zuckerberg’s post made the observation that his is a carbon copy of Larry Page’s, which is indeed very strange.</p>

<p>Here’s the statements side-by-side, emphasis mine.</p>

<h3 id="part-1-introduction">Part 1: Introduction</h3>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0.25em 0 0;">

  <p>
    Dear Google users—
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may be aware of press reports alleging that Internet companies have joined a secret U.S. government program called PRISM to give the National Security Agency direct access to our servers. As Google&#8217;s CEO and Chief Legal Officer, we wanted you to have the facts.
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    I want to respond personally to the outrageous press reports about PRISM:
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 style="clear:both; margin-top: 1em;">
  Part 2: Deny direct involvement with any government program
</h3>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0.25em 0 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Google</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First, we have not joined any program that would give the U.S. government—or any other government—direct access to our servers. Indeed, the U.S. government does not have <b>direct access</b> or a &#8220;back door&#8221; to the information stored in our data centers. <b>We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday</b>.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631">Facebook</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Facebook is not and has never been part of any program to give the US or any other government <b>direct access to our servers</b>. We have never received a blanket request or court order from any government agency asking for information or metadata in bulk, like the one Verizon reportedly received. And if we did, we would fight it aggressively. <b>We hadn&#8217;t even heard of PRISM before yesterday</b>.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 style="clear:both; margin-top: 1em;">
  Part 3: Emphasize that data given to the government is on a case-by-case basis and in compliance with the law
</h3>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0.25em 0 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Google</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Second, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law. Our legal team <b>reviews each and every request</b>, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or don&#8217;t follow the <b>correct process</b>. Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users&#8217; data are false, period. Until this week&#8217;s reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon received—an order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users&#8217; call records. We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users&#8217; Internet activity on such a scale is completely false.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631">Facebook</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When governments ask Facebook for data, <b>we review each request</b> carefully to make sure they always follow the <b>correct processes</b> and all applicable laws, and then only provide the information if is required by law. We will continue fighting aggressively to keep your information safe and secure.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 style="clear:both; margin-top: 1em;">
  Part 4: Recommend more government transparency
</h3>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0.25em 0 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Google</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, this episode confirms what we have long believed—there needs to be a more <b>transparent</b> approach. Google has worked hard, within the confines of the current laws, to be open about the data requests we receive. We post this information on our Transparency Report whenever possible. We were the first company to do this. And, of course, we understand that the U.S. and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens&#8217; safety—including sometimes by using surveillance. But the level of secrecy around the current legal procedures undermines the <b>freedoms we all cherish</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Posted by Larry Page, CEO and David Drummond, Chief Legal Officer
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631">Facebook</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We strongly encourage all governments to be much more <b>transparent</b> about all programs aimed at keeping the public safe. It&#8217;s the only way to protect everyone&#8217;s civil liberties and create the safe and <b>free society we all want</b> over the long term.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure if this is conspiracy or just laziness, but I would guess the latter. Both responses have similar wording (which is admittedly sometimes unavoidable) and are organized in the same three-part format, with the same talking point for each section.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/comparison-of-mobile-image-search-sites</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I glanced at a classmate using <a href="http://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> to perform an image search and was impressed with their presentation:</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baidu-mobile-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baidu-mobile-image-search.jpg" alt="Baidu mobile image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1163" /></a></p>

<p>Note the nice big images and the lack of margins around images. After seeing this presentation, I realized that the common approach of adding margins around images is pretty unnecessary.</p>

<p>I also noticed that the images are a variety of sizes, leading to a less sterile experience. There’s surely some clever math going on behind the scenes here to make sure the images appear “justified” (to use a word from the recent Flickr redesign).</p>

<h3 id="google">Google</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-mobile-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-mobile-image-search.jpg" alt="Google mobile image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1166" /></a></p>

<p>Note the smaller photos, which sometimes causes features on images to be indiscernable.</p>

<p>Also note the more common approach of adding margins around the images. This seems to remove a lot of space which could otherwise be used to show more details of images, which is the approach Baidu takes.</p>

<h3 id="bing">Bing</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bing-mobile-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bing-mobile-image-search.jpg" alt="Bing mobile image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1169" /></a></p>

<p>Bing uses a nicely-designed slick interface with a black background, which I tend to like a bit better.</p>

<p>However, all its images are cropped or resized to be exactly the same size, leading to a more sterile gridlike experience.</p>

<p>Also, just a minor complaint, but the search magnifying glass appears to be a tiny bit blurry, especially compared to the sharpness of the Bing logo. But it’s barely noticeable, especially compared to Yahoo (below).</p>

<h3 id="yahoo">Yahoo!</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yahoo-mobile-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yahoo-mobile-image-search.jpg" alt="Yahoo mobile image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1167" /></a></p>

<p>Yahoo has nice big images, actually a bit too big. Bit it also appears to suffer from the approach Bing uses to resize photos to make their dimensions exactly the same.</p>

<p>Again note the common white margins around the images.</p>

<p>The non-retina top graphics (logo and search button) are so blurry and distracting that I have to at least mention them here. These images look blurry on every modern phone on the market today, and it’s sad to me that neither developers nor QA cared enough about this to do something about it.</p>

<p>Strangely, these images look fine on the main “Web” tab, but they are distractingly blurry on this Images view as well as others.</p>

<h3 id="flickr-mobile-app-ios">Flickr mobile app (iOS)</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-app-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-app-image-search.jpg" alt="Flickr mobile app image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1164" /></a></p>

<p>The Flickr app itself has some decently-sized images, but here again we see the image margins at work. This is also present on the “justified view” on the desktop site, so I suppose they wanted to be consistent.</p>

<h3 id="flickr-mobile-web">Flickr mobile web</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-web-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-web-image-search.jpg" alt="Flickr mobile web image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1165" /></a></p>

<p>This is certainly the worst out of the bunch. It’s a real waste of space, with small images sacrificed for textual information that’s a little excessive for this screen.</p>

<p>I think this is just due to the website’s age. Flickr’s mobile website is much neglected and is showing its age. I would be really nice to see updates to match the nice progress they’ve made with the “justified layout” that you can see on their desktop site and mobile app.</p>

<p>Japan has a healthy fascination with the beauty of nature, and this includes the ephemeral cherry blossoms. And one of the prime locations for cherry blossoms is Kyoto, Japan.</p>

<p>It takes a while to realize, but there actually seems to be a wide variety of cherry blossoms which blossom at different times. This stretches the season out a bit (the prime blossoming lasts only about a week). It’s nice to be able to walk around for a few weeks and find random beautiful cherry blossoms.</p>

    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/how-to-import-imiwa-vocabulary-lists-directly-into-anki-ios-iphone-guide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>EDIT: big thanks to my classmate Robin from Switzerland who showed me the key steps to getting this figured out!</p>

<p>For the last six months, I’ve mainly been using imiwa? for iOS to look up Japanese words whenever I don’t know them (mostly in class). However, I found that I built up big lists without ever reviewing them.</p>

<p>The best way to review is of course through Anki, but it was a laborious process to import each word one-by-one. I should’ve figured there was an easier way!</p>

<h3 id="step-1-export-list-and-email-to-yourself">Step 1: Export list and email to yourself</h3>

<p>Most good apps, including imiwa?, include an export function. They may export directly to an Anki file (all the easier!), or they may export to a tab-delimited file, as imiwa? does. For this tutorial I’ll assume you have a dictionary that does the latter, and for the purpose of this quick tutorial, I’ll use screenshots from imiwa? on iOS as a guide.</p>

<p>Your first step is to open up imiwa? and go to the Lists tab (click the icon at the bottom):</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-list.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-list.jpg" alt="imiwa-ios-list" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1026" /></a></p>

<p>Click on the list you want to export, then click on the icon next to the Edit button at the top of the screen:</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-list-export.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-list-export.jpg" alt="imiwa-ios-list-export" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029" /></a></p>

<p>At this point we have a few options. Choose the bottom option (“Tab separated values”):</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-tab-separated-values-export.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-tab-separated-values-export.jpg" alt="imiwa-ios-tab-separated-values-export" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1028" /></a></p>

<p>After a little processing, imiwa? will finish and direct you to the email app, where you need to email the list to yourself. Just type in your email address and hit Send:</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-email-to-self.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-email-to-self.jpg" alt="imiwa-ios-email-to-self" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1025" /></a></p>

<h3 id="step-2-download-and-import-to-desktop-anki">Step 2: Download and import to desktop Anki</h3>

<p>Now switch to your desktop and download the file you emailed to yourself. It should look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-tab-separated-values-export-sample.png"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imiwa-ios-tab-separated-values-export-sample-1024x588.png" alt="imiwa-ios-tab-separated-values-export-sample" width="512" height="294" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1027" /></a></p>

<p>Note that there’s a lot of “junk” data that we won’t need when we import into Anki. Don’t worry, there’s a way to get rid of it!</p>

<p>Now open up Anki, click File -&gt; Import… and select the file you downloaded (from the email you send to yourself).</p>

<h3 id="step-3-hide-junk-columns-from-anki">Step 3: Hide junk columns from Anki</h3>

<p>When you import the file, you’ll get prompted with a screen that looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/anki-tab-delimited-import.png"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/anki-tab-delimited-import-1024x876.png" alt="anki-tab-delimited-import" width="512" height="438" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1024" /></a></p>

<p>This allows you to tell Anki which deck to import into (you probably will want to create a brand new deck), but most importantly you need to tell Anki which fields are import.</p>

<p>Here’s a typical line from a list I imported:</p>

<p>“JMDICT 1431110 直接 ちょくせつ direct, immediate, personal, firsthand L41-50″</p>

<p>In other words:</p>

<p>“1. [Junk] 2. [Junk] 3. Expression 4. Reading 5. Meaning 6. [Junk]”</p>

<p>On this screen in Anki, hit the Change button for fields 1, 2, and 6, and be sure to tell Anki to ignore them. For the rest of the fields, match them up appropriately (Field 3 is Expression, Field 4 is Reading, Field 5 is Meaning).</p>

<p>Now click the Import button, and you magically have a new Anki deck to work through!</p>

    <updated>2013-01-29T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/japan-from-miniature-train-to-bullet-train</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://library.brown.edu/cds/perry/scroll7_Forkin.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/perry-japan-miniature-train-model-train-closeup-1024x684.jpg" alt="Matthew C. Perry and the gift of the miniature train to Japan" width="1024" height="684" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1007" /></a><br />
(view the <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/perry-japan-miniature-train-model-train.jpg">full image</a>, <a href="http://library.brown.edu/cds/perry/scroll7_Forkin.html">image credit</a>)</p>

<p>A long time ago, four black ships appeared off the coast of Japan, which had closed itself off from the world and its influences. These ships were from the US, and commanding them was Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who was instrumental in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_of_Japan">reopening Japan to the rest of the world</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of this, and to promote a goodwill between the two countries, Perry gave various gifts to Japan, one of which was a one-fourth scale model train, in order to convincingly demonstrate the benefit of adopting Western technology:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perry’s gifts aimed to foster trade and good relations between America and Japan by displaying the goodwill of the U.S. as well as its technological and cultural power. This fully operational Norris Works, one-fourth scale model train, complete with 350 feet of 18-gauge track, engine, tender, and car, represented one of these “triumphs of civilization”, which Perry used to influence the Japanese. Behind the Yokohama reception hall, the Americans assembled and operated the locomotive for the Japanese officials, some of whom rode by sitting on top of the car. (<a href="http://library.brown.edu/cds/perry/scroll7_Forkin.html">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course one of the things modern Japan is now famous for is its great rail system, the epitome of which is the world-renowned Shinkansen bullet train.</p>

<p>In contrast, being born and raised in Los Angeles, I’m painfully aware at America’s recent lack of progress in rail transportation, compared to Japan and the rest of the world. Part of this can be blamed on GM and other companies, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy">in the 1930s and 1940s purchased streetcar companies only to dismantle them</a>. It’s the classic tradition of the big corporation buying up the smaller competition in order to stifle it. Unfortunately, as a result of this corporate selfishness, Los Angeles transportation is perhaps permanently handicapped. And currently it’s nearly impossible to live in LA without owning a car. And one of the wonderful benefits of owning a car is of course participating in the great modern innovation known as the traffic jam.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are finally <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gov-brown-defends-high-speed-rail-in-california-2013-1">concrete plans of bringing a bullet train to California</a>, to span Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>

<p>Of course all of this comes decades behind the progress of the rest of the world, and far behind Japan, a country which we were so proud to introduce rail transportation to back in the day.</p>

<p>Perhaps Darth Vader, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuto">his own mask being Japanese-inspired</a>, said it best: “The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.”</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Forms of Escapism]]></title>
    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2012/forms-of-escapism"/>
    <updated>2012-12-08T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2012/forms-of-escapism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been thinking lately that the fates of so many are motivated by, in a word, escapism. Including my own fate. These are folks whose lives seem quite different on first glance, but turn out to be similar. We can’t escape some of our basic human nature after all.</p>

<h3 id="the-preservationist">The Preservationist</h3>

<p>These are folks who, for lack of a better term, wish to preserve a “simpler time”. They are people such as Thoreau, who wanted a return to simpler times and aspired to self-sufficiency (or an approximation, in any case). They are folks such as the Amish, who saw no good in the coming changes, and decided to create an ideal society in the form of a living time capsule.</p>

<p>I also think backpackers and wilderness-goers fit into this category. Their journeys may be temporary escapes from city life, but they are escapes nonetheless.</p>

<p>The Preservationists stand against progress, for various reasons. These folks are most easily labeled escapists: their main drive is motivated by a desire to escape the progress of the world.</p>

<h3 id="the-progressive">The Progressive</h3>

<p>Perhaps controversially, I think the folks on the other end of the spectrum can also be placed with escapists, maybe in a small way.</p>

<p>The folks pushing progress are not satisfied with the world as it is, but instead of abandoning it (as the Preservationists do), they seek to improve their world from within.</p>

<p>They seek to to escape from the present world by changing it. And perhaps we’ve all wanted to change the world at one point or another, perhaps while we were young, and surely a long whole before we accepted that comfortable desk job at The Company.</p>

<h3 id="the-traveler">The Traveler</h3>

<p>Travelers are easily escapists, but they are temporary escapists, of course. (The more “permanent travelers” are what we call expatriots.)</p>

<p>Travelers are not necessarily unsatisfied with their current curcumstances, but their main drive for adventure of course requires them to escape from their everday routine. Or perhaps they just need a vacation, or as we so often say, an escape.</p>

<p>The traveler gets to experience an idealized, whitewashed version of everyday routine in some other part of the world. The real routine, revealed with time, isn’t as pretty as it seems. However, this is not to deny that a routine in a part of the world might be better than a routine in some other part of the world.</p>

<p>Actually, this must necessarily be the case, as it seems ridiculous to say that daily life all over the world is equally suited to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="the-recluse">The Recluse</h3>

<p>Our present technology is bringing the world together in many ways, as well as enabling reclusive people to more successfully live a literally sheltered life. These folks are paradoxes – Thoreaus who live among us in cities, even if they are rarely seen.</p>

<p>It helps the Recluse that we can now work, bank, and shop for food entirely online, enabling people to stay inside longer than ever before. Technology designed to bring us closer together ironically has stifled real-life interaction, making all of us a little more distant.</p>

<p>Whatever bad things we may think about The Recluse, we have to remind ourselves that there’s a little bit of Recluse in all of us. Who hasn’t ever been exhausted and decided to spend a “lazy Sunday” indoors, never bothering to even get dressed?</p>

<h3 id="the-suicide">The Suicide</h3>

<p>I saved the worst for last – the most extreme escapist is surely the person who removes themselves violently from the world. Perhaps they have tried the other forms of escapism, and perhaps they haven’t. Perhaps they think they know the ways of the world and are weary of it. But perhaps they are mistaken, and haven’t yet tried living other lives.</p>

<p>I’ve also been world-weary. At various points in my life I’ve felt this way, but have always wanted to try for something better without wanting to give up. This is what I’d advise anyone who feels this way: your feeling is one of extreme escapism, but perhaps there are other ways to escape. Ways which are less violent. Ways which still allow you to contact your family and friends.</p>

<p>Suicide is such an extreme form of escape, but the reason I wrote this post is to show that these feelings of escapism are widespread, and that they need not result in an “ultimate escape”.</p>

<p>The drive to escape, in its various forms, is widespread. I think it’s part of what defines us as human. And these different ways of coping are what define us as individuals.</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2012/a-theory-of-leisure-time-choice-and-happiness"/>
    <updated>2012-10-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2012/a-theory-of-leisure-time-choice-and-happiness</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is finally the end of my first week in Japanese language school here in Kyoto. It’s been quite a long week, with the most studying I’ve ever done in my life. We’ve gone through nine chapters in a week, and just Friday received two more books for learning Kanji. We’ll learn our first 50 Kanji in a week, alongside the rest of our classes. I already know some words here and there, but for the most part, much of what we’ve just learned is a blur, which is forcing me to use almost all of my free time in running to catch up.</p>

<p>Having very little leisure time has been good in some ways. It’s been a marked change in the cozy, comfortable lifestyle of sitting in front of a computer screen all day, doing tasks which were somewhat challenging but ultimately not rewarding. Those days in Silicon Valley were ended with a gratuitous amount of free time (which is unusual, working for a startup). Which seems nice for a while, but becomes a bit maddening after long, at least for me.</p>

<p>I remember moving to Silicon Valley and buying my TV and PS3 and everything to set me up with all the comforts of my new lifestyle. After coming home from work, I would waste away my time on my computer, my TV, or my video games. After long it was pretty easy to see the same mundane cycle develop: wake up, work, waste time, sleep. Rinse, repeat. Ad nauseum. Ad absurdum.</p>

<p>It became apparent that this lifestyle wasn’t really healthy, mentally or physically. It would be better, I thought, to live in a city where I needed to walk around from place to place, or take public transport. San Francisco is perfect for that, but I gave the city (or should I say “The City” as folks there do) a shot and it never really grew on me. In my short time here on Earth, I’ve found there are other cities that are better suited to me. I wanted to find a city I liked, which ended up being far away Kyoto, where I’m at now.</p>

<p>My unhealthy physical lifestyle, combined with too much free time, had resulted in an unhealthy mental state. I believe lack of exercise leads to deteriorated mental performance as well as depression, and this is what I believe I experienced. This combined with too much free time, solitude, and a brooding time resulted in days where I’d come home from work and attempt to distract myself by browsing the internet the rest of the day. I ended up absorbing the highly-prized gift of free time which I wasted with abandon, before going asleep and starting the cycle over again.</p>

<p>Now, after becoming a student, I have relearned what it’s like to have every little free time. I’m stressed out and overwhelmed already (as a beginner Japanese language student), but it feels good in a lot of ways. I feel alive, but I also feel like I’m not squandering my free time, or worrying about what I do with the free time I have. In a lot of ways I think I became maddened with the choice, and maddened with brooding in my free time over my life path and the usefulness (to society) of my career choice. Maybe I had chosen the wrong one? I wonder what it would be like if I had chosen to live in Japan after all?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both;</p>

  <p>Laugh at the world’s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that; laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret both.</p>

  <p>Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both.</p>

  <p>Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both.</p>

  <p>This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy. (Kierkegaard)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage by Kierkegaard gives a lot of insight into the brooding mind of an existentialist, but arguably offers us a glimpse at the modern human predicament. We make choices daily, and we also make great life-changing choices. It’s natural to think “Would I have been better off if I did it differently? If I choose differently?”.</p>

<p>Kierkegaard himself, if I remember right, lived off of his family’s money and didn’t have to worry about work. He had an excessive amount of leisure time, and perhaps that influenced the amount of time he had to brood over his life’s choices. He certainly had enough time to write down these thoughts, so I would think that his thoughts themselves were more numerous than his writings.</p>

<p>Since I no longer have too much free time, but rather too little of it, I have that much less time to brood over matters. I have made my choices for now (moving to Japan, studying Japanese full time), and I will only know if I’ve made the right decision after spending more time giving this path a try.</p>

<p>This is good in a lot of ways. In a lot of ways, the choice of what to do in my leisure time has been made for me. I must use it to study.</p>

<p>The choice is made! The existentialist dilemma has been, at the very least, temporarily pushed aside.</p>

<p>And at the very best, the existentialist dilemma has been conquered. “Live in Japan or do not live in Japan, you will regret it either way”. Now I have done both. I’ve now lived on both sides of the coin, on both sides of the world.</p>

    <updated>2012-10-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2012/descartes-on-building-software-frameworks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_René_Descartes.jpeg" alt="Rene Descartes" title="Rene Descartes" width="817" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969" /></a></p>

<p>Years ago I read Descartes’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_the_Method">Discourse on Method</a> for what I found to be some of the more interesting philosophy courses of my college career: those of the history of modern philosophy. Modern philosophy technically starts with Descartes, so it’s a good place to start, or to get re-acquainted with philosophy in general.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading through the Discourse again, and have found it to be more interesting and relatable this time around (particularly about lessons learned while traveling, but that’s a topic for another post).</p>

<p>What’s particularly interesting here is that a lot of what Descartes talks about seems very relevant for software engineers who wish to create their own software framework from scratch.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, I know that sounds pretty pretentious and crazy.</p>

<p>This isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem at first. Be patient!</p>

<p>But first, some background…</p>

<h3 id="what-was-descartes-up-to-does-french-count-as-a-programming-language">What was Descartes up to? Does French count as a programming language?</h3>

<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ren%C3%A9_Descartes_i_samtal_med_Sveriges_drottning,_Kristina.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/René_Descartes_i_samtal_med_Sveriges_drottning_Kristina.jpeg" alt="Rene Descartes" title="Rene Descartes" width="581" height="539" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975" /></a><br />
<em>“Oh my! I find your foundations to be awfully shaky.”</em> (note: not an actual Descartes quote)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Philosophy has been pursued for many centuries by the best minds, and yet everything in it is still disputed and hence doubtful; and I wasn’t so arrogant as to hope to achieve more in philosophy than others had done. Considering how many different opinions learned men may maintain on a single question—where at most one can be true—I regarded everything that was merely probable as being near enough to false. -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_the_Method">Descartes, Discourse on Method</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Descartes’s task, if you’ll remember, is intense self-examination where he throws out any questionable belief in order to build a strong foundation of clear and unquestionable beliefs. He doubts literally everything, until he comes to the one thing that can’t be doubted: that there is obviously <em>something</em> doing the doubting. Namely himself. This is where the concept “I think, therefore I am” comes from (“Je pense, donc je suis”, and in Latin as “Cogito ergo sum” in a later work).</p>

<h3 id="the-software-engineer-tie-in">The software engineer tie-in</h3>

<p>Software engineers, I’ve found, when given the chance, are likewise just as skeptical of the “status quo”. They take a look at the landscape around them, but find themselves dissatisfied and unable to find a perfectly suitable software framework. Of course many people do find close approximations and are perfectly happy using an existing framework. On the other hand, there are definitely purists who believe the proper thing to do is to create their own tailor-made framework from the ground up. Descartes would definitely fit into this latter category.</p>

<p>What I’ve found over my short career in software is that engineers like to build custom frameworks. Lots of custom frameworks. And they often times like to build them in a purist way, from the ground up.</p>

<p>Building your own framework turns out not only to be more interesting and fun (rather than maintaining some existing framework), but it’s also supposedly a better way to ensure a lack of cruft, and to ensure a firm foundation. A foundation which has no component that is unneeded or of which can be doubted.</p>

<p>The danger of doing otherwise, it’s thought, is that after investing the effort to learn an existing framework, one might find it wasn’t that great after all. Or worse, that it had questionable foundations which would need to be patched up. This is not unlike the task of learning an existing philosophical system, only to see holes poked in its very foundations (as the quote above states, this is essentially what philosophers have been doing for centuries – poking holes in each other’s foundations).</p>

<h3 id="better-than-maintaining-the-old">Better than maintaining the old</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regarding the opinions which I had previously held, I couldn’t do better than set out to get rid of them all at one go, so as then to replace them afterwards with better opinions or even with the same ones after I had straightened them out using reason’s plumb-line. I ﬁrmly believed that this would let me conduct my life much better than if I were to build only on old foundations and rely only on principles that I had accepted in my youth without ever examining whether they were true. Even if I were to see various difﬁculties in this project, they weren’t insurmountable, and weren’t comparable with the difﬁculties involved in reforming even minor matters affecting public institutions. -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_the_Method">Descartes, Discourse on Method</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The huge drawback of “going at it on our own” is of course the fact that <em>we</em> are now responsible for creating the entire foundation and each component of our custom framework. Descartes would be perfectly fine with this.</p>

<p>And this is exactly what he did with himself: he tore down everything he thought he knew to be true, then started to slowly build up his philosophy bit by bit. Better to do this than to patch old shaky foundations in existing philosophies.</p>

<h3 id="reusing-old-bits">Reusing old bits</h3>

<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Descartesmaison.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Descartesmaison.jpeg" alt="Descartes&#039;s house" title="Descartes&#039;s house" width="395" height="597" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979" /></a><br />
<em>Descartes’s house. Hmm, not sure the foundations are secure here…</em></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, parts of old beliefs (old frameworks) may still find their way in, but only after intense scrutiny:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as in demolishing an old house we usually keep the materials for use in building a new one, so in destroying all those opinions of mine that I judged to be ill-founded I made various observations and acquired many experiences that I have since used in establishing more certain opinions. -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_the_Method">Descartes, Discourse on Method</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, there’s some good bits out there that have already been created. Might as well reuse them if they’re good enough.</p>

<h3 id="philosophy-as-a-preview-of-the-future-of-software-development">Philosophy as a preview of the future of software development</h3>

<p>Obviously philosophy didn’t stop with Descartes. He did become the foundation for others in the modern tradition to build on (namely Spinoza and Leibniz, and most others who came after him), but of course that wasn’t the end of it. The famous “cogito ergo sum”, the foundation of Descartes’s philosophy and seemingly common sense, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum#Criticisms">hasn’t even been immune from criticism</a>.</p>

<p>Folks have continued to build philosophies and have continued to be unsatisfied with what’s out there, or unconvinced that it’s even useful in this age.</p>

<p>I believe we approach software frameworks, software itself, and even programming languages the same way. Unsatisfied with what’s out there, people will continue to build new things and new tools which work for the time being for certain groups of people.</p>

<p>Inevitably, a new generation of developers, not unlike a new generation of philosophers, will eventually tear it all down and start over again.</p>

    <updated>2012-09-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2012/the-life-of-your-parents-choosing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Several times I’ve heard the phrase “the religion of your parents’ choosing”, used to scoff at adherents to various religions, as if they had no intelligent choice in the matter of their own beliefs. As the thought goes, religious standing (or lack thereof) should be a personal matter, one to be decided rationally (yes, there is such a thing as rational faith; to say otherwise is to label all religious people as fideists, which is a mistake) by individuals, apart from their social group if possible.</p>

<p>How strange then not to carry this philosophy into more of our social behaviors. Why should we then avoid phrases such as “the culture/land of your parents’ choosing”?</p>

<p>It seems to me that this carries the same implications as religious belief. For instance, permenently moving to another country is in a sense turning one’s back on their upbringing and their whole social group. Of course this isn’t a total turning away: a person might return to one’s home country after many years, just as they might return to their faith after many years away.</p>

<p>Both of these moves seem only possible after exposure to different ways of thinking, something increasingly made possible as the modern world progresses. It should be of little surprise then that more people will test the waters of other faiths, or lack of faith, just as they may test the waters of living in a different culture. It seems increasingly easy to do, especially in a highly individual-centered culture. Trying a new career or a new life may be a challenge, but it might have the same motive as turning over in bed: the current position has become uncomfortable, and a new position becomes increasingly more alluring.</p>

<p>Some people may stay in their new culture, new career, new faith – their new way of life – and some may eventually return.</p>

<p>Either way they are forever changed, and hopefully for the better: hardened by experience and permanently viewing the world through a different lens.</p>

<p>Either way I think is better than not having ventured out at all.</p>

<em>“…but the hackers will not find intelligence of corporations and governments, or signs of a vast conspiracy…” -Stratfor CEO George Friedman, January 2012</em></p>

<p>…eight months later…</p>

<p><em>“WIKILEAKS: Surveillance Cameras Around The Country Are Being Used In A Huge Spy Network” -Business Insider, August 2012</em></p>

<p>In case you haven’t noticed, there been some big news released recently as a result of another release of documents by Wikileaks on August 9, 2012. The documents are [emails from the global intelligence company Stratfor][2]. The most recent release has confirmed what many conspiracy theorists have feared for years: that the government is operating a vast secret surveillance network that is collecting data on citizens and their movements.</p>

<p>The news has been surprisingly (or unsurprisingly?) absent from major news sources, so I’ve collected a few of the major articles here:</p>

<p>[http://www.salon.com/2012/08/10/biggest_story_you_missed_7/][3]<br />
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trapwire-everything-you-need-to-know-2012-8">http://www.businessinsider.com/trapwire-everything-you-need-to-know-2012-8</a><br />

<a href="http://reason.com/blog/2012/08/10/creepy-spying-system-revealed-by-wikilea">http://reason.com/blog/2012/08/10/creepy-spying-system-revealed-by-wikilea</a></p>

<p>And here’s a link to the mirror of the recent Wikileaks email release: <a href="http://mirror2.wikileaks-press.org/gifiles/releasedate/2012-08-09.html">http://mirror2.wikileaks-press.org/gifiles/releasedate/2012-08-09.html</a></p>

<p>Though this has been suspected for a while now, I read the news with a huge sinking feeling. Conspiracy theories always have the virtue of the remote possibility of being wrong. But now with the theory confirmed, it appears that global surveillance has been implemented on a scale and degree much worse than CCTV ever was or could’ve been, with a technology purportedly much more sophisticated than just facial recognition. I fear the genie has escaped the bottle, and it will be impossible to put it back in again.</p>

<p>The technology itself has been created by TrapWire, a company which, according to the leaked emails, supplies both the US government and various companies with surveillance equipment. (Side note: interestingly enough, the technology bears a striking resemblance to a controversial new technology [INDECT][5], apparently in use in the EU since 2009).</p>

<p>TrapWire actually has a [website][6] on which it outlines, on first glance, its [well-intentioned philosophy][7]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most modern critical infrastructure and asset protection programs are focused on improving perimeter security, access control, and incident response. While prudent, these physical security measures are reactive — designed to mitigate the effects of an attack, rather than prevent the incident from occurring in the first place. At TrapWire, we have shown that we can achieve better results, and do so much more cost effectively, by shifting the focus from mitigation to prevention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, preventative measures are both more cost-effective and more effective in general. Actually, I think most folks would agree with this. Considered alone, of course we would like to be able to prevent crimes before they occur.</p>

<p>However, if the tradeoff is living in a state of constant surveillance, I believe the cost to be too great.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I believe any actions to create a state of constant, unwarranted surveillance is directly contradictory to the spirit in which our nation was founded, for what it’s worth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I’m not sure that is worth much in general these days.</p>

<p>I hope that quote [rings familiar][8], because I fear as time marches on, those words will ring less and less familiar, until they are stamped out completely and disappear into the vague memory of the past.</p>

<p>Already I fear that the powers that be are trying to distract us and prevent us from hearing the TrapWire news and making an informed judgement for ourselves.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Wikileaks has been under massive DDoS attacks since the beginning of the month, resulting in their site being inaccessible. In all fairness, these attacks started occurring before the latest email leak on August 9, but there is something undeniably fishy about the timing of the attacks.</p>

<p>There is also something very fishy about the group that’s taken responsibility for the attacks on Wikileaks: a purported new group called AntiLeaks, whose leader released [this statement on August 8][9]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can call me DietPepsi. I am the leader of AntiLeaks. We are not doing this to call attention to ourselves. We are young adults, citizens of the United States of America and are deeply concerned about the recent developments with Julian Assange and his attempt at aslyum in Ecuador.</p>

  <p>Assange is the head of a new breed of terrorist. We are doing this as a protest against his attempt to escape justice into Ecuador. This would be a catalyst for many more like him to rise up in his place. We will not stop and they will not stop us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have the keen ability to spot bad actors while watching movies or TV shows. I also detect some bad acting here, and so do most other folks.</p>

<p>In all, it seems quite Orwellian, and it seems clear that someone doesn’t want us to find out about their Orwellian plots. Perhaps they would’ve attracted less attention if they were more forthcoming and transparent? But now people are rightfully curious as ever.</p>

<p>It’ll be interesting what will become of this, but at this point I’ve become a bit pessimistic. I think this will pass and be forgotten, along with the Occupy Movement and any other glimpse of true hope and true change that could come to this country.</p>

<p>Perhaps all this is leading me back to the stark realization that it is time to follow in the steps of my ancestors and leave my country in search of a new and better one? In search of a better life?</p>

    <updated>2012-08-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2012/more-fun-with-webkit-pseudoelements-webkit-search-cancel-button-or-pseudoclass-inception</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>(check out the <strong><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/webkit-search-cancel-button.html">Demo</a></strong>)</p>

<p>A while back I had a bit of a field day <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/implementing-iphone-slider-unlock-with-input-type-range">messing around with input type=”range”</a>, trying to replicate the “unlock slider” on iOS using CSS, targeting special WebKit-only CSS pseudoelements such as webkit-slider-thumb.</p>

<p>Well, now I’m at it again, this time with a much simpler use case, trying to implement a custom “clear” button on search field inputs (note that this only works on input type=”search”):</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/webkit-search-cancel-button.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/custom-webkit-search-cancel-button.png" alt="Custom webkit-search-cancel-button" title="Custom webkit-search-cancel-button" width="239" height="145" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914" /></a></p>

<h3 id="details-about-the-implementation">Details about the implementation</h3>

<p>It turns out this is relatively easy to do, and is somewhat supported, at least in the latest Chrome and Safari 6. Note that it does work on iOS6, but not on iOS5, but the positioning is slightly different from the other implementations. No idea about Android, so I’ll leave that for someone else to find out. <img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>So how do we do it? First, we need the special WebKit CSS pseudoselector (<code>-webkit-search-cancel-button</code>), and secondly, we need to use that to wipe out the default WebKit styling (with -webkit-appearance: none;):</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="pseudo-class">::-webkit-search-cancel-button</span> {   // <span class="key">select</span> <span class="key">all</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">X</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="key">buttons</span> <span class="key">in</span> <span class="key">search</span> <span class="key">inputs</span>
    <span class="key">-webkit-appearance</span>: <span class="value">none</span>;      // <span class="key">hide</span> <span class="key">the</span> <span class="key">default</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">X</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="key">button</span>
}
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>You would think that the next step might be adding our own custom background-image to this element, but unfortunately it won’t work that easily (of course).</p>

<p>What we need now is a little bit of trickery, using an <code>:after</code> pseudoclass on the pseduoclass (!?). The result is a bit of “pseudoclass Inception”:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>

</div>

<p>So it turns out you can still whatever you like in there really, even text content (see the last text input in the <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/webkit-search-cancel-button.html">demo</a>). You may even need to tweak the positioning a bit, in which case you can learn from the same example (you will need to set position:relative on the cancel button itself to anchor the position:absolute <code>:after</code> content – check out the code).</p>

<h3 id="final-notes">Final notes</h3>

<p>Note that this is just an experiment, not a robust use case that I’m recommending as a cross-browser solution (obviously, since it’s WebKit-only).</p>

<p>In the case of wanting to implement something similar cross-browser, I recommend absolutely-positioning a button element over an input element, then adding the appropriate right-padding to the input as necessary, then hooking up the “clear all text” behavior with the help of JavaScript.</p>
