<p>Earlier this year I had the opportunity to attend my first philosophy class in about a decade.  The class was on the infamous philosopher Martin Heidegger, and the course was taught at Stanford University by Forrest Hartman (PHI 98: An Introduction to Martin Heidegger (Spring 2016)).</p>

<p>Heidegger is famous for being obscure and notoriously difficult to read, but I believe I made some headway in what turned out to be a very interesting philosophy.  Most interestingly, though Heidegger is considered to be a “continental” philosophy, I found some common ground with Quine, who is considered to be an “analytical” philosophy, supposedly in a diametrically opposed camp.</p>

<p>I’ve been meaning to post this for a while - this is the paper I wrote for the class.  Would be interested in any feedback!</p>

<p>For convenience, <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/writing/David%20Calhoun%20-%20Quine%20and%20Heidegger.pdf">here it is in PDF form</a>!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Comparing two thinkers from opposite philosophical traditions may initially seem like an impossible and fruitless task, a sort of culture clash two cultures cognitively thousands of miles apart.  It should be easy to find the points of departure between Quine and Heidegger<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but what I’m more looking forward to here is what seems to be an eerie agreement on a few key topics, in particular reactions against science: a move back towards accepting metaphysics, against the dominant trend of their time.  And a move away from a reductionist approach and towards a more holist view of knowledge.</p>

<p>Their seeming agreement here is almost as if two wanderers have hiked up a mountain from opposite sides, eventually arriving at the same peak.  And when two very different thinkers end up at similar positions, at the very least I think we should have a look.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-look-at-quine">A quick look at Quine</h2>

<p>It makes sense to take a look at Quine first, because he represents a tradition which Heidegger is reacting against.  Being from the analytic philosophical tradition, Quine sees his work as a continuation of the philosophical tradition initiated by Descartes (modernism).  A tradition that strives for exactness in methods and in its own writings, seeking clarity and concision<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.  This all seems well and good coming from the point of view of science, however this tradition has been criticized for being too focused on language and science, too sterile and academic, and consequently for ordinary people, not only inaccessible but sadly irrelevant for them.</p>

<p>Quine himself wouldn’t argue that science should be so closely tied to philosophy: in Quine’s view, philosophy somewhat cohabitates with science<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.  And sometimes philosophy is even secondary, as something that comes along afterwards in order to clarify and clean up little messes and points of ambiguity that science has left behind.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>How can we even begin to understand the world with this approach?  For science, phenomena is king: it is from phenomena that we get observation sentences, which are foundational for scientific understanding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Typical observation sentences are about bodies: ‘This is a table,’ ‘This table is square,’ ‘The cat is on the mat.’. Always the situation that makes an observation sentence true will be a situation that is intersubjectively observable; that is, it will be the sort of situation to which multiple witnesses could, if present, attest.”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s important to note here that this methodology distinguishes between witnesses and bodies; between subjects and objects.  Unfortunately this disconnect has lead to many problems for this philosophy and its descendants: subjects can never have direct access to objects<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.  Consequently there is always an untraversable distance between us and our world; the extreme of this being external world skepticism, that we can never be sure we have knowledge of the world as it <em>really</em> is in itself.  This troublesome view seems to be confirmed by the “progress” of philosophy through the centuries: philosophical frameworks are confidently built up only to be later gleefully destroyed in a seemingly endless churn.</p>

<p>What is the nature of reality?  Who knows, but the next generation of philosophers will surely have a different answer.  This long and seemingly unsuccessful churning of philosophy was one of the reasons for Descartes’ radical questioning, and wanting to rebuild philosophy on firm foundations.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Yet science cannot afford to endlessly doubt, sit still and not make progress, and so it must start somewhere.  The best science can hope for is a sort of pragmatic approach: to aggregate multiple observation sentences from multiple subjects (the “multiple witnesses” in the statement above), and hope that the observations agree.  For a philosophy based on science, these observations end up being foundational for all meaning and knowledge.  This leads to a logical extreme, the verification theory of meaning, the theory that “…the meaning of a statement is the method of empirically confirming or infirming it.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>.  In other words, an extreme approach which <em>reduces all meaning down to merely scientific observation sentences</em>.</p>

<p>Quine reacts against this view in his most famous paper, Two Dogmas of Empiricism, and it’s here that we find strange similarities to Heidegger’s views in Being and Time.</p>

<p>But more on this later, since first we need to consider Heidegger’s own approach.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-look-at-heidegger">A quick look at Heidegger</h2>

<p>Heidegger himself comes from the continental philosophical tradition and sees his work in opposition to Descartes in many ways.  We would say he represents a sense of anti or post-modernism.  Some would also accuse him of being obscure and difficult to understand, in many cases purposely unclear and imprecise<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup>.  Also, some might see Heidegger’s stance as anti-science<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup>, though this is a mischaracterization, at least of the Heidegger of Being and Time, which is my focus here.</p>

<p>For Heidegger, philosophy is clearly the starting point for knowledge, that which must be made clear before examining other domains such as the sciences<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>.  Heidegger’s project is actually similar to Descartes’ in the sense that both are looking for a foundation, a starting point from which to begin philosophy.  Descartes looks to build from a firm <em>epistemic foundation</em>, obsessed with certainty: starting from the only thing which he can’t reasonably doubt: that he exists.  The famous cogito ergo sum: “I think, therefore I am”.</p>

<p>But Heidegger takes him to task for not digging deep enough: “he leaves the ‘sum’ completely undiscussed, even though it is regarded as no less primordial than the cogito.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup>  This “sum”, the “I am”, is what Heidegger calls Dasein, the study of which he thinks should be prior to all other study.  Dasein isn’t a what but a who.  Dasein is <em>us</em>, something that is mysteriously close and yet far: “that which is ontically closest and well known, is ontologically the farthest and not known at all”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>.  Heidegger thinks we should not start with epistemology as Descartes did, but with metaphysics, specifically with the <em>fundamental ontology</em> of Dasein.</p>

<p>Here the method of examining Dasein might strike us as very unusual, because the very nature of Dasein refuses to be categorized as any other object that has properties to be examined, like Descartes’ “thinking substance”.  No, Dasein is something strange and is not like other beings: it cannot be talked about as a what but as a <em>who</em><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>, as a living-through experiences<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>, of intentional actions<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup>.  It’s not something which we can study with our scientific toolbox, the world of subject and object.  (Note that we need not throw out the idea of subject/object entirely, only when discussing Dasein<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Also, there is no problem of not being able to see <em>things in themselves</em> for Heidegger.  There is no untraversable distance between subject and object with Dasein, because there is no subject/object distinction.  Dasein <em>experiences things as they are in themselves</em>, albeit in a different way than the Kantian sense.</p>

<p>Note that we cannot also apply science’s familiar reductionist strategy here: Dasein is not some object to be broken into parts which can then be classified and understood individually<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup>, then added up again to understand Dasein as a whole.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup>  One of the reasons being that it’s problematic that we would even know how to “put the world together again”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> - that already-knowing-how is exactly what Heidegger is trying to uncover: trying to “get behind” or get “prior” to this already-knowing-how to put the pieces back together.</p>

<p>Yet we can still talk about Dasein’s structure<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> in what Heidegger calls “existentialia”: various ways of describing states of Dasein’s Being<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup>, perhaps most importantly for our discussion: Dasein being-in-the-world (in a sense the world is “embedded”, but in a different way than things are usually “being-in” each other – it’s difficult here to avoid the subject-object language we’re usually accustomed to<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup>).  Being-in-the-world and other structures of Dasein turn out to be equiprimordial: they are prior and impossible to “get behind”, so much so that they must be presupposed and cannot be questioned<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What’s vital to understand here is that it’s impossible to take any of these “existentialia” out of the world and look at them in isolation, then look at them individually as if in a petri dish; the scientific approach of reducing our world down into smaller, more understandable parts.  These structures of Dasein can only be examined in relation to each other as part of a whole, as a part of a holistic understanding.  To examine in isolation is to examine away from its natural habitat, and thus what Heidegger would call an “inappropriate” study that yields no understanding.  Instead of examining parts in isolation, Heidegger’s “hermeneutical circle” approach is both an attempt at expressing this difficult holism and also an explanation of Dasein’s ontological understanding of itself<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-thinkers-compared">The two thinkers compared</h2>

<p>Coming back to our comparison with Quine, it may be very difficult at this point to see where Heidegger might have any points of agreement at all.  Heidegger in a sense seems to have jumped into the deep end of metaphysics, starting philosophy at the farthest point away from empiricism (science).  And from everything I’ve outlined above, we may think that Quine would here be on the front lines defending science against these strange speculative metaphysics of Dasein.  But the reality turns out to be quite different.</p>

<p>In his well-known Two Dogmas of Empiricism, Quine goes on the attack against the logical positivists, an extreme group of empiricists who fundamentally believed that all truths can be <em>broken down into pieces</em> that end up being either analytic (such as mathematical proofs) or synthetic (such as scientific statements)<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup>.  Both points of Quine’s attack end up forcing us out of this extreme reductionist view and into a position that forces us to embrace a sort of holism, in a very different sort of way than the traditional scientific reductionist view.</p>

<p>Quine’s first point of attack is against a distinction that goes back to Kant: that truths are either analytic or synthetic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Analytic sentences: propositions “grounded in meanings independently of matters of fact”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> - such as “all bachelors are unmarried”, which are supposedly able to speak for themselves in complete isolation, like mathematical truths.</li>
  <li>Synthetic truths: propositions that we must go out into the world to find out about – sentences such as “bachelors are lonely people”.  These are the sorts of truths uncovered by empiricism (science).</li>
</ol>

<p>Quine attacks this distinction by explaining that it’s impossible to even explain how analytic sentences have meaning in isolation.  For instance, how do we know that “bachelor” is equivalent to “unmarried man” - don’t we have to consult a dictionary or have some prior knowledge to make such a statement?  We also must have some of idea of synonymy <em>beforehand</em>, to understand the very meaning behind something like “A is the same as - is synonymous with - B” in order to understand a sentence such as “all bachelors are unmarried”.</p>

<p>It turns out that “pure” analytic sentences are not so pure after all: in every case it’s impossible to understand the sentence in isolation, without appealing to some wider body of knowledge.  In each case, as Heidegger might say, there is <em>always-already an idea of synonymy</em>, and for that language speaker, always-already an understanding of the meaning of “bachelor” and “unmarried”.</p>

<p>The result of Quine’s discussion is that it seems there is no distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions at all: there actually appear to be no true analytic sentences that can “stand on their own”.</p>

<p>The second prong of Quine’s attack is more explicitly against reductionism in general, which is somewhat a continuation of his first attack.  Where Quine was previously attacking isolated analytic sentences as incomprehensible, he also says it makes no sense to talk about synthetic statements being meaningful by themselves.  No, observation sentences, of science and otherwise, only have meaning in relation to a larger body of observation sentences, an entire <em>web of belief</em>.  And it turns out that one observation sentence might challenge the whole web of belief and force some beliefs to be rejected, while in other cases supporting other beliefs.</p>

<p>Each observation sentence affects the whole web of belief.   Each observation sentence <em>has meaning only in relation to the whole web of belief</em>.</p>

<p>This should seem very similar to what we discussed previously in regards to Heidegger’s hermeneutic circle approach, and his resistance to talking about any of the existialia by themselves, in isolation from the others.  Just as Quine argued that one observation sentence by itself has no meaning, but only meaning in relation to the whole web of belief, so too does Heidegger argue that it’s inappropriate to speak of the existialia of Dasien without understanding its activity, its be-ing, in the whole of Dasein.  That is to say, the whole hermeneutic circle approach.</p>

<h2 id="leaving-the-door-open-for-metaphysics">Leaving the door open for metaphysics</h2>

<p>Also, as it turns out, in the wake of Quine’s attack on logical positivism, it once again becomes useful to look towards metaphysics, something science in general seems to try to shy away from.  Where logical positivists were trying to shut the door on all metaphysics, Quine now puts his foot in the door, leaving open the possibility to talk about metaphysics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The same normativity which leads Quine to attack logical positivism … encourages a more modest metaphysical attitude … it would seem sensible to be liberal about the possibilities of speculative metaphysics. Quine blurs the boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science…”<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leaving open the possibility for metaphysics is of course crucial, as all of Heidegger’s philosophy starts with metaphysics: the fundamental ontology of Dasein.  Yet of course Quine is still coming from perspective of the vastly different scientific different world, and would definitely not agree that philosophy should start with metaphysics like Heidegger does.</p>

<p>In a way, Heidegger has his own view about how we must approach philosophy, but he accommodates science and allows it to be useful and to exist in its own world as a regional ontology.  And Quine, though coming from a scientific background, has his own view about how we must approach philosophy, his own argument moderates the extreme scientific view of the logical positivists and actually ends up accommodating metaphysics, keeping the door open for speculative metaphysics such as Heidegger’s.</p>

Thus the circle of understanding is not a methodological circle, making it unnecessary for us at the end of the process of interpretation, but it describes an element of the ontological structure of understanding. An understanding is fundamentally circular. Heidegger appeals to the hermeneutical circle in order to express the existential fore‐structure of Dasein - according to his view, understanding ontologically occurs in a circular manner. The world of Dasein is the mental horizon of Dasein that consists of its presuppositions, expectations, attitudes and beliefs.” (The Hermeneutical Reflections of Heidegger, Ahmad Vaezi, Transcendent Philosophy, Volume 3, Number 3, September 2002) <a href="#fnref:26" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We Americans believe we have a right to be the way we want to be, which includes being lazy physically and intellectually. Junk is more shiny and more entertaining than non-junk, after all, and we can’t be bothered to be bored with non-junk.  We now have many forms of poison that we unwittingly ingest in various ways.  We have created in many ways our own version of the gladiator games that the masses celebrated through the downfall of Rome.</p>

<p>We are attracted to politicians for their image over all else. Never mind the arguments, or the truth which all politicians unabashedly lay claim to.  Did they speak in a confident way at the last debate? That’s what I really care about.  Because confidence is what we really need in a leader, over all else. Did they provide nice entertaining zingers in rebuttal to their opponent?  Because those witty one-liners are what we need to lead the free world.</p>

<p>Did someone sniffle during the last debate? Did someone stumble over their words? Did someone physically stumble and need help getting into their van?  Did Mr. Funny Man With A Funny Name ask a question at the debate?  I forgot what question he asked, or what the answers were.  What brand was his sweater?  I’d like to wear it this Halloween so I can poke fun at people who don’t appear super polished on TV.  These are the things that really matter.</p>

<p>This is no doubt the era of image politics, not issue politics (arguably this has been happening since the Kennedy-Nixon debates…).</p>

<p>Just like junk image politics, junk TV is more entertaining than non-junk TV, and we are attracted to it like flies to garbage. Cable TV has become a cesspool, and not coincidentally. Networks have found what people are attracted to, and maximized its airing time in order to maximize viewers.  Create masses of junk, and people will flock to it.</p>

<p>And food!  We are attracted to junk food, and not just snacks - even junk added to our main meals. I would argue that the staple food of the US is now sugar. It’s in everything. We eat it with abandon and oftentimes unknowingly. Without regard for long-term effects and without regard for how it affects our bodies and minds.</p>

<p>Because we have a God-given American right to eat what we want, just like our forefathers intended.  George Washington would be proud that I ate a fruit rollup for breakfast, followed by two burgers for lunch.</p>

<p>And we defend our body images in all shapes and sizes, because we have a right to it, dammit.  And we are beautiful and healthy regardless of what anyone says. I have a right to live my life the way I want to, without regard for what anyone else says. That’s the American Way©, after all (copyrighted by North American Coca-Cola).</p>

<p>We defend our version of the truth, because we have a God-given right to it. I have a right to believe what I want to. It’s the American Way to live my life and believe what I want to.  If you question or challenge me, you are attacking my very way of life.  And that’s super unamerican.</p>

<p>We defend the position of our in-group, and anything said against that position is an attack on the in-group itself. We have a right to our position, and it’s more important to show confidence and unwavering commitment to that position than to show hesitancy and a wavering opinion.  And we like to blast our politicians for waffling on positions, never thinking that maybe it’s healthy to reassess beliefs over time.  I’m gonna stick to my guns on this one.</p>

<p>America is undoubtedly in a decline.</p>

<p>And we have a God-given right to be in decline, dammit!</p>

    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/time-for-autumn-adventures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="666" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/kyoto-autumn-maple-leaves-tofukuji.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/kyoto-autumn-maple-leaves-tofukuji.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Maple leaves at Tofukuji Temple, Kyoto" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Maple leaves at Tofukuji Temple, Kyoto</figcaption></figure>

<p>It’s autumn again.  The temperatures are dropping up here in the mountains of Big Bear, especially at night, when it’s now approaching freezing or below.  A surprising number of trees are changing colors.  I say surprising because this is California, after all, and we don’t usually see fall colors unless we know where to look.</p>

<p>The aspens are of course doing their thing and changing from green to yellow, and there are other surprising splashes of red and orange as I drive through the neighborhood.  So it’s getting cold and the colors are changing - sounds like a pretty typical autumn, right?</p>

<p>But down the mountain it’s a different story.</p>

<p>It will be October in a few days, and for much of the 300 square miles of Southern California suburbia, that means one of the hottest times of the year.  It usually cools down briefly, but September and October have always been known to be hot.</p>

<p>And the winds!  My dad complains that his birthday falls during one of the most uncomfortable times of the year, when the warm Santa Ana winds come to fan the flames of the inevitable wildfires.  This time last year a wildfire got too close for comfort at our place in Big Bear.  Vast tracts of land were destroyed, including a beloved trail that my parents used to hike when they were younger.</p>

<p>Because of that fire the county regulations are a bit stricter now.  We’ve had to cut back some the plants to leave space between them.  The shrubs are no longer wild and overgrown - they’ve been chopped back to thin and small regulated sizes, with precisely measure space between them.  They now look like they belong more in a zen garden than in a mountain town.  And all the shrubs in the neighborhood have fallen in line and have the same regulated dimensions.  I might not have much in common with my neighbors here, but we all received that same letter from the county.  We are unified in a common bond by the regulated size of our shrubs.</p>

<p>I’m learning what autumn means here.  It means that some days are very windy, and that wind helps shake things to the ground.  First it’s the pine needles, and later the aspen leaves.  Mountains of yellow aspen leaves.  I spent some much needed time sweeping them up from the driveway and street today, but for a while now I know this will seem like a real sisyphean task.  By next week, these trees will have shaken off more leaves and dispersed them all over the place for us to sweep up again.</p>

<p>The house under construction nearby looks finished, but I guess it’s not quite ready.  I can still hear construction crews working there during the day.  Sometimes they briefly blast music out over the neighborhood while they work.  But if it was me, I’d be embarassed - the age of the music gives away the age of the construction workers.  They seem to be too old to still be in that line of work.  Or maybe they just like older music.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to taking a few drives to see autumn in the eastern sierras.  I hope to get some good shots!</p>

<p>And I’m looking forward to the eventual winter.  Instead of taking care of the leaves and pine needles on the driveway, I’ll trade in my broom for a snow shovel.  My task will still seem sisyphean for a brief period of time, then the seasons will change again.</p>

<p>It all goes by too fast really.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a movie in the same spirit as the Marx Brothers’ Duck Soup: essentially a string of crazy anarchic skits held together weakly by some central theme.  The story isn’t strong, but it doesn’t pretend to be and it really doesn’t need to be.  It’s just there as a sort of skeleton to hang all the skits on.</p>

<p>As a movie, this feels to me to be strangely out of place in the top 100 movies, maybe because it’s such a low budget production.  But being low budget is also part of its charm and humor.  It fits easily into the top 100 <em>comedy</em> movies of all time however.</p>

<p>I remember getting introduced to the movie by my high school philosophy teacher, who described Monty Python as funny, but sometimes too silly.  And the humor sometimes inpenetrably British.</p>

<p>The movie follows the adventures of King Arthur (Graham Chapman) in his quest for the Holy Grail.</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night/"/>
    <updated>2016-06-14T06:15:52-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before setting off on my current trip, I wanted to give myself at least one “photo assignment”: some goal I could aim to accomplish by pretending like I’d been given an assignment by some employer.</p>

<p>This is the first of what I hope will be many.  The assignment here is to try to capture the atmosphere of eastern Kyoto’s traditional streets at night.</p>

<p>A couple of things I had to plan for: Kyoto is a bit far from my hostel in Osaka, so I made sure to make a day trip out of it.  Also, I wanted preferably a somewhat rainy day, which would make the ground more reflective.</p>

<p>One more thing: the more shots during magic hour, the better.  The sky ends up a lot more beautiful that way.</p>

<p>Ok go, let’s have a look at what I ended up with!</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="666" /><meta itemprop="height" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-1.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-1.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Walking up the path towards Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Walking up the path towards Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Walking uphill through the shops that are just closing, approaching the pagoda.  Not quite magic hour yet.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="666" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-2.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-2.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Vending machines lighting up the path" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Vending machines lighting up the path</figcaption></figure>

<p>The light the the vending machines is completely blown out.  I took some bracketed shots of this, but I don’t want to deal with the HDR right now… maybe later.</p>

<p>Just a funny note: instead of the RAW file, I actually ended up postprocessing the HDR JPG for this one accidentally.  Took me a while, but I finally corrected my mistake when I was seeing weird artifacts appearing.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="666" /><meta itemprop="height" content="981" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-3.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-3.jpg" width="666" height="981" title="Looking down on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Looking down on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)</figcaption></figure>

<p>I had a tough time trying to crop this one.  The posters on the right side are interesting and I wanted to zoom in more on them, but couldn’t find a way to make it work.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="666" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-4.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-4.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Hydrangeas on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Hydrangeas on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Some hydrangeas on a wet street.  This is more like it, this is the kinda shot I came here to take!  There really was no one around at this time.  Most of the folks in the area were camped out with tripods to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4mq25f/i_took_a_picture_of_a_quiet_street_at_night_in/">duplicate a shot they had seen on reddit</a> (which I ended up doing later…).</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="666" /><meta itemprop="height" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-5.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-5.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Street near Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Street near Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Not sure about the composition here, in terms of the balance.  But I liked the design of the window on the left.  Reminded me of something elven, like it came out of the Lord of the Rings.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="666" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-6.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-6.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Bar Main Higashiyama Kyoto" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Bar Main Higashiyama Kyoto</figcaption></figure>

<p>Before I took the following shot, a bartender dressed in fancy clothes skurried past to return after his break.  Actually wasn’t so sure about this photo was worth taking when I was here, but it ended up turning out pretty well!</p>

<p>The bluish light cast a nice reflection on the still-wet ground.  Quick, keep snapping pictures before it dries up!</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="666" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-7.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-7.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Shōren-in gate （青蓮院門跡）" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Shōren-in gate （青蓮院門跡）</figcaption></figure>

<p>The ground dried up by the time I made it here…</p>

<p>I remember crowds up people lined up around here at New Year’s 2013, waiting to ring in the New Year by ringing the bell at the nearby Chion-in temple (知恩院).  It was a cold night, and I ended up bailing out of the line after more than an hour of waiting.</p>

<p>This time I revisited on a warm night, with kind of a creepy atmosphere with no one around.  There was just this imposing gate dimly lit, with signs explaining that it’s closed for the day.  If you look closely, you can even see a little security camera up there.</p>

<p>I ended up walking through a LOT of Kyoto late at night this night.  I walked up to the Path of Philosophy and saw a few fireflies on the way.</p>

<p>I eventually went up to Hyakumanben neighborhood, to the delicious Tenkaippin ramen place near where I used to live and go to school..  had delicious “stamina ramen” with kotteri broth with a ton of other folks around 11:30pm, then ended up walking back towards the Kamogawa only to realize that the trains were out of service for the night.</p>

<p>Ended up walking back to my hotel near Kyoto station, but not before passing even more fireflies by the Kamogawa.  Returned to my hotel around 2am or so… this was a fun night, really reminiscint of that first time I quit my job to come live here for the summer.</p>

<p>Where I sometimes wandered around aimlessly at night, thinking what in the world I was doing here.  Never imagined I’d return here five years later to do the exact same thing, to be at the exact same point in life with seemingly no progress made whatsoever.</p>

<p>I came here not without a purpose this time, but it looks like my time here is almost at an end, and I still have no answer.</p>

<p>For better or worse, it’s time to keep wandering.  I will try to take pictures while I keep wandering!</p>

<p>The biggest culture shock of Indonesia had to be the bathroom facilities, but that’s best saved for another post.  The second biggest culture shock had to be the roads, and the drivers on them.</p>

<p>I’ve never been to any third world Asian country before, so the idea of seeing roads dominated by scooters and motorcycles was really a foreign concept to me.  This also meant that the style of driving is way different.  There is plenty of honking, mostly as a way to say “I’m here” and nothing more.  I didn’t really see anyone get upset because they were being honked at here - nothing like things might be in New York, for instance.</p>

<p>Another scary thing is they way drivers are not afraid to overtake each other.  Wherever we went we took taxis or larger vans.  Our drivers would often pass slower motorcycles even when it wasn’t 100% clear on the other side, since they could effectively used the middle of the road, with motorcycles in each direction on the sides.</p>

<p>It was often scary, especially when it was rainy and late at night, when our tour driver needed to get back in a hurry.</p>

<p>In any case, we survived.  So enjoy this video of one of the calmer moments in Lombok.  Keep an eye out for the horse and buggy.  No idea what that’s all about - maybe they keep it around for the tourists?</p>

<p>(I wrote this one a few weeks back but didn’t post the pics until now, so here it is in its complete form!).</p>

<p>I’ve been here in Japan for a month and in true form haven’t provided much in the way of updates since then.  Doh.</p>

<p>Here’s a catch-up post, with plenty of pictures and videos to keep things interesting.</p>

<p>Spring in Japan again!  I was really happy to use jetlag to my advantage and wake up super early while staying in Kyoto, where I was able to walk over to a few areas that turned out to be almost empty, but were sure to get crowded later.  I’ve found that this trick always works if you’re willing to wake up early enough - this also worked for Yosemite, a place as crowded as Disneyland.  Except the trick there was to wake up before dawn…</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="666" /><meta itemprop="height" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-kyoto-path-of-philosophy-cherry-blossoms-1.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-kyoto-path-of-philosophy-cherry-blossoms-1.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Cherry blossoms along the Path of Philosophy" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Cherry blossoms along the Path of Philosophy</figcaption></figure>

<p>Anyhow, I really felt that one stroll through the fairly empty Path of Philosophy early in the morning was enough to satisfy me for the entire trip.  I felt super happy, and was lucky to get some video of a fairly empty Path of Philosophy, around 7am or so.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jtq7pfeXhh0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>With every passing hour it was noticeably getting more crowded, so my plan from there was to escape and head down for a walk along the Kamo river (Kamogawa), which is big enough that it never feels super crowded.  It was also a good chance to revisit old favorite cafes like efish.  Can’t beat Kyoto coffee culture!</p>

<p>After this I realized that I was pretty satisfied, and maybe even burnt out on crowds.  I really felt like getting out if Kyoto, so I cancelled some hotels (with 100% refund, really easy to do when you book through Expedia).  I realized that I got really burned out on tourists a lot sooner than I hoped.  Knowing full well that I myself am a tourist of course, and that I’m contributing to the problem…</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="455" /><meta itemprop="height" content="303" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-shinkansen-route.png" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-shinkansen-route.png" width="455" height="303" title="The planned crazy Shinkansen route, to fully take advantage of my JR Pass like never before" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">The planned crazy Shinkansen route, to fully take advantage of my JR Pass like never before</figcaption></figure>

<p>But this burnout happened to have good timing.  I found out that Yuka was briefly headed to China for work, so it was a good time to activate my weeklong JR Pass and do something I’ve always wanted to do: abuse it as much as possible, traveling as far in one direction as I could.  I always thought it would be fun to travel north to Hokkaido by shinkansen, and by good coincidence it turns out this wasn’t possible until the end of this March this year, when a stretch of track was just opened that went all the way to Hakodate.  My eventual goal was to arrive at Sapporo by shinkansen, but that final stretch is still being constructed.  But no worries, there was an express train there instead.</p>

<p>On the first day of my JR Pass adventure, I made an escape from Kyoto and headed northeast.  I only stopped briefly in Tokyo to change shinkansen trains, then I was off again to Furukawa, a sleepy town just north of Sendai.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lff7ZQff8uE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I’d randomly chosen to stop here before on a previous trip and enjoyed the slower pace.  The town itself doesn’t really have much to offer, but that’s ok.  I also knew that hotels were super cheap all around northern Japan - about 5000 yen ($45) for a decent business hotel with a good breakfast included.  I could definitely stretch my money a lot further compared to more expensive and touristy places like Kyoto.  I discovered a good business hotel chain there: Hotel Route Inn, which seems to serve all of northern Japan.</p>

<p>The next leg of the trip was from Furukawa to Hakodate, a small town in Hokkaido.  Being in Hokkaido, this means the shinkansen ran out of land and would either have to go over or under the water to get to the island of Hokkaido.  Disappointingly, it turned out to be under water: vast stretches of the trip that were in boring tunnels.  I suppose the option to build a bridge would’ve provided a beautiful sight for passengers, at the expense of a maintenance nightmare, as this would mean repair crews would have to battle the harsh winters, exposed out on a bridge over the ocean.  I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the eventual Hakodate to Sapporo track will be underground for the same reason.</p>

<p>Hakodate was nice, although the touted night view from Mt. Hakodate was overcrowded with tourists.  Especially Chinese tourists for some reason.  I think the night view of city by the sea, with mountains in the background, is hard to beat.  It’s worth seeing once though.</p>

<p>The last leg of the journey was from Hakodate to Sapporo on an express train.  Not quite a shinkansen, so the trip covered comparatively little ground, but the train was nice and was setup nicely inside with assigned seats, tray tables for food, nice storage areas.  It was an express train trying its hardest to be a shinkansen.</p>

<p>I didn’t mind the comparative slowness of this express train actually: the countryside here was probably the most beautiful part of the trainride, with ocean views and interesting forests and mountains with interesting shapes in the distance.</p>

<p>One thing that did surprise me about this stretch was that although the view of the ocean water very near the track was beautiful, there were vast stretches where pieces of trash had washed up on shore.  There must’ve been thousands of fishing baubles and other random debris washed up there.  I wondered to myself if it had always been like that, or if it was lingering trash from the tsunami five years before?  Maybe no one cared about cleaning it up because these towns were out in the middle of nowhere.  It is a shame though, since so much trash could be seen from the train.  I would think even JR (the train company) might have an incentive to sponsor a beachside cleanup, to beautify the view for its passengers along this stretch?</p>

<p>I finally made it to Sapporo and stayed for two nights.  It’s a big city but doesn’t feel overcrowded like other Japanese cities.  Maybe because it was freezing outside - literally.  There was sleet and snow while I was walking around - very strong bursts at times.  I didn’t plan well for this - all I had packed that would help against this was a windbreaker.</p>

<p>It became too cold and soon it became clear I needed to take a building-by-building strategy, from heated building to another heated building.</p>

<p>Canon photo gallery?  Ok why not, I like Canon.  And it’s warm.  When I eventually left, I made it a block or two until I got too cold, and saw the next building to go into.</p>

<p>A bookstore?  Oh sure, I like books.  And it’s warm.  Oh, I forget that I’m illiterate here.  English books are hard to find…</p>

<p>Ok, exit and walk another block through the sleet.  7-11?  Hmm sure, I’m sure I could buy some random junkfood or something there.  And it’s warm there.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="666" /><meta itemprop="height" content="892" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-sapporo-711-snow.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-sapporo-711-snow.jpg" width="666" height="892" title="A Sapporo 7-11 while it started snowing.  I definitely stepped into this 7-11 for some warm comfort." /><figcaption itemprop="caption">A Sapporo 7-11 while it started snowing.  I definitely stepped into this 7-11 for some warm comfort.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Walk a little further and see a Tully’s Coffee. Ok why not, I like coffee.  And it’s warm.</p>

<p>Eventually I realized that having some insulation would be nice, if even for the day or two I was up there.  I found some department stores, but the clothes were either too strange and peculiarly Japanese (and too small), or too foreign and therefore expensive.  $700 jacket from Henry Cottens Italy?  No thanks, that’s more than I’m paying for rent here in Osaka (my rent is 50000 yen, less than $500).</p>

<p>I settled for some long underwear and undershirt from Uniqlo, then put them on in a bathroom.  Now I could go out and take pictures in the snow!</p>

<p>But unfortunately I kind of squandered my opportunity to take interesting snowy city pictures of Sapporo.  I was walking around all day with my 24mm lens, which is a difficult focal length to work with.  Should’ve probably stuck with my trusty 50mm.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="666" /><meta itemprop="height" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-sapporo-ramen.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-sapporo-ramen.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Delicious Sapporo ramen" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Delicious Sapporo ramen</figcaption></figure>

<p>On this trip I also learned to pack a bit smarter.  On previous trips I’d brought a massive suitcase and packed way too much stuff.  I remember one longterm trip where I’d packed a flatbed photo scanner, just because I could really.  And I thought I needed it, to scan forms that I needed to sign or something.  I’m still not entirely sure what I was thinking.</p>

<p>I guess way back then I learned that packing a massive suitcase was somewhat doable but a real hassle, especially when transporting it from place to place.  For instance, when traveling on the shinkansen you can only hope that there’s space at the back of the traincar to store the suitcase.  There’s some limited space there, and it turns out not to be an issue, but it’s far more convenient to have multiple bags which can be broken down and stored in the overhead compartment (kinda like an airplane, but uncovered), which is what I did this trip.</p>

<p>Another hassle of super large bags is that they can only be stored in super large coin lockers, which are hard to find and more limited.  Also, good luck trying to find one during this time of year, which is the most popular time to visit…</p>

<p>Anyhow, the moral of the story is that on this trip I traveled smarter.  Of course the less the better, so I think I could definitely improve it still.</p>

<p>See the interactive <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/2016-01-31-big-basin-hike.html">GPS track log here</a>.</p>

<p>I really needed to get out of Silicon Valley again and go experience nature, so on Sunday I drove over to my favorite hiking spot, Big Basin.  There’s a $10 fee to get in and park, but it’s worth it considering it’s about the price of a movie and much more rewarding.</p>

<p>I arrived right after the park opened and started my hike to Berry Creek Falls at 8:20am, which is probably the earliest I’ve started there.  Today was a bit difficult because of the recent rains: much of the trail was very muddy, and I found myself stopping a few times to try to work out the best path through the mud.</p>

<p>And yes, I fell down into the mud.  At least three times.</p>

<p>What was maybe more alarming was the fact that on the way to Berry Creek falls there were multiple newly-fallen trees that were blocking the path.  In one case a tree had completely destroyed a bridge, and I had to find a way over or under the tree.  I unded up going over, walking along the slippery log and then working my way to the other side.  I tried making my way down slowly instead of jumping, which was a bad choice - I grabbed onto a piece of the decaying tree, but it broke off and I slid down a bit…</p>

<p>I made it to Berry Creek Falls, where I’d been before a few years back.  There was a lot more water gushing down the falls this time!</p>

<p>I felt up for it, so I decided to continue the hike on the Berry Creek Falls trail, saw a few more waterfalls I’d never seen before, and then met up with the Sunset Trail, which I took back to the park headquarters, making it about a 11 mile loop.  Started at 8:20am, took some breaks and a lunch stop at Golden Cascade Falls, then finally made it back to my car around 2:20pm.</p>

<p>I definitely brought back lots of mud with me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve seen Casablanca more than a few times, and it’s become one of my favorite films.  For this review I got to experience it in 35mm at the wonderful nearby Stanford Theatre.</p>

<p>But that’s not how I first experienced it.  I first watched it at home and half paid attention to it.  A lot of the movie was lost on me and I thought it was overrated, just ok, and not that great.  My views have changed, in case you haven’t guessed.</p>

<p>It does seem to be a film that takes repeated viewings to “get”.  The script is brilliant, every line has its place.  If you look away for a few scenes you may miss some clever back and forth that’s worth watching again to catch.</p>

<p>The pacing is mostly great and still holds up well for modern audiences.  I struggled to find a scene that I could get up for popcorn for.  Every scene had classic lines that I didn’t want to miss.</p>

<p>This film is chock full of classic one-liners that have become part of our culture in their own rite really.  It’s through the love of this film that that’s even made possible.</p>

<p>This is a film that is best experienced, not explained in a post like this.  However, that being said, I’ll give this a try anyhow.</p>

<p>I’ve avoided this film all my life out of dread more than anything.  It’s somewhat weird then that I watched this so early in my “Top 100” films quest.  I knew I’d have to watch it eventually anyhow.</p>

<p>Everyone who has seen this said it’s a good movie but is very depressing and dark.  Not that we’d expect anything less from a movie about the grim realities about the Holocaust.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="563" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-02-liquidation-of-the-ghetto-grandmother-and-nazis.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-02-liquidation-of-the-ghetto-grandmother-and-nazis.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="Liquidization of the ghetto.

<p>I came into the movie already knowing that I’d see many people die in gruesome ways, and that I’d see the Nazis misbehaving.  But maybe I’m a bit desensitized.  I’ve seen Nazis act in outrageous ways in movies and videogames all my life.  That familiar Nazi outrageousness, oozing evil, does appear in Schindler’s List.  But here it’s factually grounded, which makes it eerie.  In this movie there is little in the way of an exaggeration - all of these things did happen.</p>

<p>Amon Goeth is the supernazi we are made to hate the most.</p>

<p>He appears completely out of control, as he indiscriminately shoots down prisoner Jews like he’s hunting deer.  Or more precisely, shooting fish in a barrel.  I want to somehow think this is a fiction, that this is the product of an overzealous writer looking for new ways to portray Nazis as outrageously evil.  But I look up Goeth and find that he exists, and that he did exact what he is portrayed doing.  That is somehow surprising to me.  I desperately wanted his random shooting to be a work of fiction.</p>

<p>This is a movie that knows how to use extreme contrast to bring focus on things.  It has a few scenes in color, but most of the movie takes place in black and white.  The black and white scenes sometimes include very selective color: the famous girl in a red jacket and the color in the flames of burning candles.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="563" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-06-girl-in-red-coat.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-06-girl-in-red-coat.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="The girl in the red coat." /><figcaption itemprop="caption">The girl in the red coat.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Schindler picks out a girl in a red coat in the chaos of the liquidation of the ghetto.  He later sees the corpse of the girl that’s been exhumed, to be put on the giant pile of bodies in a mass incineration.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="563" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-10-death-of-the-girl-in-red.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-10-death-of-the-girl-in-red.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="Corpse of the girl in the red coat." /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Corpse of the girl in the red coat.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It’s here that he really shows vulnerability as a character.  He loses his cool exterior and is shocked.  He realizes he needs to do something.  He needs to take action.</p>

<p>It’s here that he creates a list that the movie takes its namesake from.  This is a list of Jews that he will bribe officials to keep at his factory, and keep them safe and away.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="563" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-12-oskar-schindler-and-itzhak-stern.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-12-oskar-schindler-and-itzhak-stern.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="Schindler and Stern drawing up a list." /><figcaption itemprop="caption">Schindler and Stern drawing up a list.</figcaption></figure>

<p>One part that really resonated with me was the misfortune of a group of women who were on Schindler’s List - the ones who I knew should be protected.  The killing in general is a horrible thing during the film, but it’s a fact and I prepared myself somewhat for it.  When Schindler drew up his list of those he would protect, I became invested in their well-being, because I know they had been chosen to be kept safe.  Somehow I found myself empathizing with them more.</p>

<p>So all the more the shock when a traincar of women who were on his list somehow was diverted to the wrong place.  The train pulls into an eerily familiar-looking courtyard.  We don’t need to be told where this is, but the film lets us know anyway: Auschwitz.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="563" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-13-auschwitz-train-arrival.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-13-auschwitz-train-arrival.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="The train arrives at Auschwitz." /><figcaption itemprop="caption">The train arrives at Auschwitz.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Auschwitz.  Some of the protected Schindler Jews ended up at Auschwitz?!</p>

<p>What’s worse - they have heard secondhand stories of mass gassings, and they find themselves going through the motions through which what appears to be the same process.  They undress and are herded into the showers.  This could be their end.  But they were on the list - they were the ones that weren’t supposed to die in this movie, right??</p>

<p>But it’s just water, not gas.  A huge relief for the entire group, as naked and helpless as they still are.</p>

<p>There is also extreme contrast in Schindler himself.  Throughout the movie he is nothing but a smooth character who maintains control and appears to exert control, even when briefly tossed into prison for kissing a Jew.  But this smooth exterior vanishes at the end when he accepts the gift of a ring and starts trembling so much that he drops the ring.  His reaction is almost out of character, because his facade breaks down.  He realizes he could have sold even more of his possessions to save a few more lives, on top of the 1100 lives he has already saved.</p>

<p>The end of the film has an artful transition into the current day, with the real remaining Schindler Jews at the time paying their respects to Schinder’s grave.</p>

    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/ikiru-1952-top-100-films</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="729" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-title-card.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-title-card.jpg" width="1000" height="729" title="IKIRU, 生きる, TO LIVE" /><figcaption itemprop="caption">IKIRU, 生きる, TO LIVE</figcaption></figure>

<p>This is an existentialist story about a man who learns he has stomach cancer, leading to his reconsidering of life, which he realizes has been utterly wasted up until this point.</p>

<p>As it turns out, he realizes he hasn’t really been living at all.  What’s inadvertently happened is that his job has turned into his life - the job of being section chief at one of the endless wasteful government bureaucracies.  From the point of his diagnosis, his challenge is trying, in the brief life he has left, to figure out what it means to actually live.  Thus the name of the film in English: TO LIVE.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="732" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-dark-lighting.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-dark-lighting.jpg" width="1000" height="732" /><figcaption itemprop="caption"></figcaption></figure>

<p>This is a sad and deeply disturbing film, not disturbing in the explicit sense of a horror or a war movie, but disturbing because these are the horrors of everyday life.  It is too real: the horror of mundane office life, of government bureaucracy, of the disconnect between life and work, of a cancer slowly eating away at remaining life, of life’s clock itself ticking down, chiming each hour closer to death.  The horror of growing old and losing vitality and life’s energy.</p>

<p>In the very opening of the film, a group of women is petitioning a government agency to turn a cesspool into a children’s park and playground.  In typical government fashion, the responsibility is pushed from department to department, with no one department wanting to take responsibility.  Thus the park becomes a pretty clearly established MacGuffin.</p>

<p>The protagonist - Kenji Watanabe - has been diagnosed with stomach cancer, but is initially alone in his discomfort, with no one close or trusting enough to help him.  Even the doctors themselves are distrustful, as they don’t directly tell him his diagnosis - Watanabe has to find out indirectly.  After his diagnosis he walks outside of the hospital and we get the sense that he no longer belongs in the world - the busy street with with cars speeding by is in a sense life itself passing by - something that is now very alien.</p>

<p>It’s a world in which he no longer belongs.</p>

<p>He’s an outcast at work, the boring boss figurehead who’s probably in his position based on seniority alone.  He’s also an outcast at home, where his wife died many years ago, and where he now lives with his ungrateful and highly dislikable son and his son’s girlfriend.  He reflects on his life which was devoted to his son, and wants to break the news of his cancer to him.  He looks for various ways to tell him.  But the son has turned his back on him and effectively blocks him out.</p>

<p>There’s no one close enough for Watanabe to break the news to.  The first person he tells is a complete stranger at a bar, an apparently alcoholic struggling writer.  Watanabe eventually confesses that he wants to learn how to live life, and asks the writer to help him spend his money all at once, while he still has time.  The writer refuses his money and instead offers to pay with his own money, which immediately makes him the first character Watanabe can trust.  They go out and visit all the vices of nightlife in the city: booze, clubs, loud bars, crowded dance halls, stripteases.</p>

<p>They find themselves at a club with a piano player playing a boogie-woogie tune which people are energetically dancing to.  People dancing, full of life.</p>

<p>Watanabe requests an old song which gives away his age: the hit of 1915, Gondola no Uta (ゴンドラの唄, “The Gondola Song”).  People try to dance to it, but he sings in such a depressing way that is a downer for everyone there.  The camera pulls back from the face of the writer, whose thin and pale face is baring his lower teeth, and his whole appearing perhaps not coincidentally resembling a skeleton, utterly in shock.</p>

<p>The night ends with a taxiride home with some revolting and annoying prostitutes.  Watanabe has to get the taxi to stop so he can vomit on the sidewalk.  It’s the reminder of his stomach ulcer, a problem that cannot be drunk away.</p>

<p>But it turns out these places aren’t what Watanabe is looking for.  The day after, he roams the streets continuing to look, and by chance runs into a young girl from work.  A girl that is still very full of life, as revealed by her innocent full smile.  A girl that doesn’t belong at Watanabe’s workplace, and is consequently quitting.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="732" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-smiling-girl.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-smiling-girl.jpg" width="1000" height="732" title="" /><figcaption itemprop="caption"></figcaption></figure>

<p>Back home, the son has blocked him out with his newspaper, and the son’s girlfriend with her knitting and furtive glances.  They are so resistant and are unable to listen.  They think he’s having a relationship with the young girl from the office, and accuse without even listening to Watanabe.</p>

<p>Watanabe meets with the girl one last time, and finally confesses that he has cancer and not long to live, and that his life has been a waste.  He confesses that the girl brings out some life still remaining in him.</p>

<p>The girl is now working at a factory making toy bunnies, and she explains how she feels as if by making the toys she’s reaching out to all the children across the Japan.  She has found a workplace where she belongs.  She has found meaning in her work.</p>

<figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center"><meta itemprop="width" content="1000" /><meta itemprop="height" content="785" /><meta itemprop="url" content="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-rabbit.jpg" /><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-rabbit.jpg" width="1000" height="785" title="" /><figcaption itemprop="caption"></figcaption></figure>

<p>“Why don’t you try making something too?” she says.</p>

<p>And then his haunting reply: “It’s too late.”</p>

<p>But soon after he appears to have a realization.  He leaves the girl and walks straight out of the restaurant, with a clear and definitely purpose.  It’s the last we see of the girl - she’s served her purpose in showing him the way.  “Happy birthday to you” is playing for a young girl as Watanabe is exiting the scene, but it’s really his birthday, or rather his rebirth.</p>

<p>“Happy birthday to you” plays again as Watanabe goes out to personally inspect the future park site - this becomes his life goal.  The challenge that no government agency wanted to take on.</p>

<p>Then the scene cuts to five months later.  Suddenly Watanabe is dead.</p>

<p>This is the climax of the film, which happens at a somewhat unusual place.  The rest of the story is told through his funeral and flashbacks.  This is really my only complaint with the movie - we have to spend the rest of the movie in a room with people we’ve grown to dislike and distrust.  Coworkers, bureaucrats, and the uncaring son and girlfriend.  The bureaucrats continue bureaucrating, and try to take credit for building Watanabe’s park, an effort they all quickly turned down at the beginning of the film.</p>

<p>Then very briefly, some people we trust and care about: the group of women originally petitioning for the park arrive and mourn very intently at Watanabe’s altar, an act of sincerity which inadvertently shames the insincere bickering bureaucrats.</p>

<p>Then we return to the room of people we dislike, and we are forced to spend more time with these unlikeable characters.  Because of this I think this part just drags on much longer than needed, and slows down the pacing of the film.  But then there is some redemption: some of the bureaucrats finally acknowledge Watanabe’s efforts, and they appear to be themselves inspired and changed.</p>

<p>We also get flashbacks of Watanabe stubbornly running up against challenge after challenge to get the park built, even in the face of gangsters, presumably the Yakuza, who showed him leniency.  I think this is worth showing briefly, but it’s already been strongly established that this government is a very inefficient and resistant to change, so much of this seems like unnecessary storyline that makes the film drag.</p>

<p>However, all this waiting and slow pacing leads to a worthwhile payoff: the policeman stopping by the funeral to return Watanabe’s hat and pay his respects.  He’s the one that recounts the very beautiful scene with Watanabe singing his Gondola Song on a swing in his new park, amidst falling fresh snow.  That’s the last we see of Watanabe alive, and how truly alive and happy he was.</p>

<p>The film ends with a strong hint that some coworkers’ attitudes and behaviors have now been changed by Watanabe, and that his efforts have affected more change than just the children’s playground.  His actions have really lead to a greater good in the world.</p>

<p>This has become one of my favorite films, for the very reason that it’s a challenge to how we should live.  This is how art and how films can improve our lives and make us better people - they involve us in a world and let us learn from the characters in that world.  And from this film is the challenge calling out clearly: live your life, create, don’t waste your life, do good through your work.</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/a-journey-through-the-top-100-films/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-05T09:26:33-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/a-journey-through-the-top-100-films</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s the beginning of January, which means the beginning of a new year.  And you know what that means - a time for making resolutions that will probably not be kept!  Well, let’s see how far this one goes…</p>

<p>Instead of wasting away my time playing video games, I’ve decided to take a bit more seriously another passion: watching movies.  I’m going to try to make this constructive by reviewing each of the top 100 movies, many of which I’ll be sitting down and watching for the very first time, and many of which are old favorites that I’ll be rewatching, unfortunately not with fresh eyes.</p>

<p>This should be completely doable, as this comes out to watching roughly 2 movies a week.  The part I expect to be time-consuming are the reviews for each film, which I want to be worthwhile to read, with screenshots and such, to keep the readers’ eyes stimulated between the walls of text I’m sure to write.</p>

<h2 id="selecting-the-100">Selecting the 100</h2>
<p>My method for selecting the top 100 movies is to take the unweighted <a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/title?count=100&amp;groups=top_250&amp;sort=user_rating">highest rated films on IMDB</a> and filter out anything from the last 15 years, meaning that all of these films will be pre-2000.</p>

<p>This may seem pretty arbitrary to some folks, but if you’ve watched the IMDB rankings for any period of time you’ll notice new movies have a tendency to show up high in the rankings for a brief period before falling lower over time.  My guess here is that time is a sort of sieve, and as such it takes time for the sieve to filter these newer movies.  But I can sort of speed up that process by jumping back 15 years (because 2000 is a nice round number), to movies that the sieve has had time to work on.</p>

<p>The more recent films are also in our more recent collective conscious - you can see this reflected in the distribution of films by decade below.</p>

<p>Also, this somewhat avoids the type of film rankings where Citizen Kane always shows up as #1, and most of the pre-1980 classics seem to have strong preference over anything recent.</p>

<h2 id="some-quick-statistics">Some Quick Statistics</h2>

<p>See the interactive <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/2015-10-25-big-basin-hike.html">GPS track log here</a>.</p>

<p>On Sunday I grabbed two sandwiches at Le Boulanger, and headed for a late hike in Big Basin, which is my favorite place to hike in the area.  The drive from my apartment in Sunnyvale is almost an hour and a half, and the fee to park is $10, but it’s worth it to go and spend time there once and a while.</p>

<p>I’ve found I can usually find parking very easily at the very end of North Escape Road, near the camping area, which ends up being a much more secluded start to the hike.  Starting from there you can immediately cross over the river and then see the site of the Maddock Homestead right across the river.</p>

<p>From there I traveled up north along the Skyline to the Sea trail, pretty much going as far as I could before sunset, when the trails close.  I got back just as it was getting tough to see with the unaided eye.</p>

<p>Along the way I saw a TON of ladybugs um.. how should I say this.. in the process of making a TON more ladybugs.  I didn’t have my macro lens with me, but I’m tempted to go back just for more of these pictures.  I’ve never seen anything like this before!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(In case you didn’t guess, this is a parody.  Please dont send me emails!)</p>

<p>I’m looking to find a fit and lean partner who can iterate rapidly on our relationship. The MVP for this partner is someone who can keep me entertained with user stories. Bonus point if the stories have a point (or several, as long as we keep to fibonacci numbers, which I have a strange fetish for).</p>

<p>Must be willing to get up out of bed each day and stand-up together with me.</p>

<p>I had good velocity in my previous relationships, but when it came to intimacy, there were too many blockers. Probably because when it came to demo time, nothing ended up working.</p>

<p>I do have a backlog of dates planned, but no worries - we can have a planning together to figure out the schedule.</p>

  <p>Andre: OK. Yes, we are bored. We’re all bored now. But has it ever occurred to you, Wally, that the process that creates this boredom that we see in the world now may very well be a self-perpetuating, unconscious form of brainwashing, created by a world totalitarian government based on money, and that all of this is much more dangerous than one thinks?  And it’s not just a question of individual survival Wally, but that somebody who’s bored is asleep, and somebody who’s asleep will not say no?<br />From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRBZDmf1jSw">My Dinner With Andre</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless I die young, I haven’t quite made it to my midlife crisis yet.  But it does seem to me that I’ve heard more and more about people experiencing their “quarter-life” crises.  Is this something new?  Or have people always had so many of these doubting periods?  Or maybe we’re at a time where so many of us have the freedom and luxury to even contemplate such a thing, a freedom that leads to our own detriment.</p>

<p>I’m admittedly not great at math, but it does seem to me these quarter-life crises should occur in someone’s early 20’s.  Is that crisis somehow supposed to eventually pass, or just it just get quietly ignored while we distract ourselves with other concerns?  Then we learn to get comfortably numb and sleepy and learn to accept life for how mundane it really is?  Can a midlife crisis still re-emerge later on in life, after a person wakes up again?</p>

<p>I’m fairly certain I’ve been asleep these past few years.  I wouldn’t be surprised, since I do like to sleep (I sometimes waste entire weekends on the couch or in bed, but that’s another story).</p>

<p>I’m too old for these childish quarter-life crises.  The only explanation for this current one is that I must’ve graduated to the rarely-if-ever-mentioned third-life crisis.  A relevant question to ask myself here: just how many damn life crises is it normal for someone to have, and do they ever stop?</p>

<p>In my 20’s I graduated college, had a choice of career paths and started to float and drift a bit, getting a job testing cellphone games.  There I made some friends, but it didn’t really advance my career or my personal life outside of that.</p>

<p>I got older, I worked more, I got a job at a big corporate job, doing what I thought was a decent career.  But I learned that big corporate jobs are soul-numbing.  I quit my big corporate job and did the inevitable clichéd trip to Asia.  Particularly in my field, folks seem to get the same idea.  (Not unlike other things I suppose: Everyone wants to travel to Asia, everyone wants to move to Portland or Austin, everyone wants to save up for a house, everyone wants a Tesla).</p>

<p>That experience traveling helped me grow as a person more than any job ever did, but apparently I didn’t grow or learn enough, because I found myself falling into the same pattern as before.  Get the comfortable corporate job, dance like a monkey if I wanted to advance and get promoted, then try to save up for a house like everyone else.</p>

<p>The idiotic Silicon Valley version: save up for a down payment on a ridiculously overpriced house that’s in the bad part of town and also falling apart (because that’s the only one you can afford making comparative chump change to everyone else).  Maybe also save up for a Tesla, so at the very least you can brag to your coworkers that you bought a Tesla.  Because Tesla.</p>

<p>Then you get a job at what’s supposed to be the Best Place To Work In The Universe, according to a survey of all known workers in the universe.  You find that it’s not too much different than your previous Big Corporate Job.  Is this really all there is to look forward to?  So I can buy a house and a Tesla?  What next after that even?  Work the rest of the best years of my life paying off the house?</p>

<p>What if I don’t want a house (though not sharing walls would be nice)?  What if I don’t want a Tesla?  I don’t think I’m the only one.  I think all those folks who quit their jobs to travel the world likely have the same feelings.  They’re trying to escape from something.  Their inner selves seem to have woken up from a nightmare in the night, and are restlessly awake, pacing back and forth.  Except they’re pacing through the world, not just their bedrooms.</p>

<p>Some of these folks even get the idea that the ideal lifestyle is being a traveling nomad, hopping from country to country, somehow earning enough money to get by.  If they can make it work, I think they do tend to be happier, or at least more alive and more childlike and inquisitive.  Is it just the permanent change in scenery?  I’m not sure I’d be comfortable in that sort of lifestyle myself.  It is always nice to come back home eventually, and to spend time with familiar friends and family, and familiar things in general.  Sometimes it’s nice to be a little hobbit-like.</p>

<p>Is all this travelling and escaping just a delaying of inevitable adulthood?  What if I’m already an adult - does it mean I’m just deceiving myself?  Am I running away from myself?  Is adulthood really just the acceptance that you’re not special, that this really is the only thing life is about?  That your life is the thing that happens for a few brief hours after work, and entire weekends that you may end up wasting on stupid pursuits?</p>

<p>As much as philosophy has helped me, in cases like this I think it’s kind of made me dissatisfied with everything.</p>

<p>Maybe I can still somehow play and enjoy the game of life, even if I realize it’s only some silly game we’ve concocted to keep ourselves busy?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’d been looking for a night like tonight for a long time, when the new moon fell squarely on the weekend.  The only problem: unpredictable weather!</p>

<p>I drive about an hour and a half south on the 101 and then the 25 to head towards the east Pinnacles entrance, which I’d never been at before.  I also chatted with Yuka over LINE for a bit of it, at least until the reception got bad and dropped the call about ten minutes beofre getting to the park.</p>

<p>In any case, I made past the folks camping nearby, to the wide open dirt parking lot.  I rolled down my window, and stuck my head out the window to look up at the sky.  Wait, what sky?  It turned out to be clouds.  100% clouds.</p>

<p>The forecast said it would be partly cloudy, which has sometimes meant 10% clouds whereas other times…  Well, I guess this fell into the “other times” category.</p>

<p>Just proves that you can’t win them all, and you can’t plan everything.  Sometimes you just have to travel a lot and occassionally get lucky.</p>

<p>Like the time the moon was rising straight over the road behind me on the way to my parents’ house in Big Bear, but I didn’t have my camera stuff ready in time.  That would’ve been an awesome shot, but now it’s an awesome memory.</p>

<p>Or the time I drove up Whitney Portal Road to get a shot of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/franksvalli/13234418335">the snow-covered mountains that you could see visibly glowing under the moonlight</a>.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
