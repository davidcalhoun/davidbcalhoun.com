    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a movie in the same spirit as the Marx Brothers’ Duck Soup: essentially a string of crazy anarchic skits held together weakly by some central theme.  The story isn’t strong, but it doesn’t pretend to be and it really doesn’t need to be.  It’s just there as a sort of skeleton to hang all the skits on.</p>

<p>As a movie, this feels to me to be strangely out of place in the top 100 movies, maybe because it’s such a low budget production.  But being low budget is also part of its charm and humor.  It fits easily into the top 100 <em>comedy</em> movies of all time however.</p>

<p>I remember getting introduced to the movie by my high school philosophy teacher, who described Monty Python as funny, but sometimes too silly.  And the humor sometimes inpenetrably British.</p>

<p>The movie follows the adventures of King Arthur (Graham Chapman) in his quest for the Holy Grail.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Photo assignment: Kyoto alleyways at night]]></title>
    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night/"/>
    <updated>2016-06-14T06:15:52-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before setting off on my current trip, I wanted to give myself at least one “photo assignment”: some goal I could aim to accomplish by pretending like I’d been given an assignment by some employer.</p>

<p>This is the first of what I hope will be many.  The assignment here is to try to capture the atmosphere of eastern Kyoto’s traditional streets at night.</p>

<p>A couple of things I had to plan for: Kyoto is a bit far from my hostel in Osaka, so I made sure to make a day trip out of it.  Also, I wanted preferably a somewhat rainy day, which would make the ground more reflective.</p>

<p>One more thing: the more shots during magic hour, the better.  The sky ends up a lot more beautiful that way.</p>

<p>Ok go, let’s have a look at what I ended up with!</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-1.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Walking up the path towards Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)" /><figcaption>Walking up the path towards Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Walking uphill through the shops that are just closing, approaching the pagoda.  Not quite magic hour yet.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-2.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Vending machines lighting up the path" /><figcaption>Vending machines lighting up the path</figcaption></figure>

<p>The light the the vending machines is completely blown out.  I took some bracketed shots of this, but I don’t want to deal with the HDR right now… maybe later.</p>

<p>Just a funny note: instead of the RAW file, I actually ended up postprocessing the HDR JPG for this one accidentally.  Took me a while, but I finally corrected my mistake when I was seeing weird artifacts appearing.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-3.jpg" width="666" height="981" title="Looking down on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)" /><figcaption>Looking down on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)</figcaption></figure>

<p>I had a tough time trying to crop this one.  The posters on the right side are interesting and I wanted to zoom in more on them, but couldn’t find a way to make it work.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-4.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Hydrangeas on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)" /><figcaption>Hydrangeas on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Some hydrangeas on a wet street.  This is more like it, this is the kinda shot I came here to take!  There really was no one around at this time.  Most of the folks in the area were camped out with tripods to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4mq25f/i_took_a_picture_of_a_quiet_street_at_night_in/">duplicate a shot they had seen on reddit</a> (which I ended up doing later…).</p>

<p>Not sure about the composition here, in terms of the balance.  But I liked the design of the window on the left.  Reminded me of something elven, like it came out of the Lord of the Rings.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-6.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Bar Main Higashiyama Kyoto" /><figcaption>Bar Main Higashiyama Kyoto</figcaption></figure>

<p>Before I took the following shot, a bartender dressed in fancy clothes skurried past to return after his break.  Actually wasn’t so sure about this photo was worth taking when I was here, but it ended up turning out pretty well!</p>

<p>The bluish light cast a nice reflection on the still-wet ground.  Quick, keep snapping pictures before it dries up!</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-7.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Shōren-in gate （青蓮院門跡）" /><figcaption>Shōren-in gate （青蓮院門跡）</figcaption></figure>

<p>The ground dried up by the time I made it here…</p>

<p>I remember crowds up people lined up around here at New Year’s 2013, waiting to ring in the New Year by ringing the bell at the nearby Chion-in temple (知恩院).  It was a cold night, and I ended up bailing out of the line after more than an hour of waiting.</p>

<p>This time I revisited on a warm night, with kind of a creepy atmosphere with no one around.  There was just this imposing gate dimly lit, with signs explaining that it’s closed for the day.  If you look closely, you can even see a little security camera up there.</p>

<p>I ended up walking through a LOT of Kyoto late at night this night.  I walked up to the Path of Philosophy and saw a few fireflies on the way.</p>

<p>I eventually went up to Hyakumanben neighborhood, to the delicious Tenkaippin ramen place near where I used to live and go to school..  had delicious “stamina ramen” with kotteri broth with a ton of other folks around 11:30pm, then ended up walking back towards the Kamogawa only to realize that the trains were out of service for the night.</p>

<p>Ended up walking back to my hotel near Kyoto station, but not before passing even more fireflies by the Kamogawa.  Returned to my hotel around 2am or so… this was a fun night, really reminiscint of that first time I quit my job to come live here for the summer.</p>

<p>Where I sometimes wandered around aimlessly at night, thinking what in the world I was doing here.  Never imagined I’d return here five years later to do the exact same thing, to be at the exact same point in life with seemingly no progress made whatsoever.</p>

<p>I came here not without a purpose this time, but it looks like my time here is almost at an end, and I still have no answer.</p>

<p>For better or worse, it’s time to keep wandering.  I will try to take pictures while I keep wandering!</p>

<p>The biggest culture shock of Indonesia had to be the bathroom facilities, but that’s best saved for another post.  The second biggest culture shock had to be the roads, and the drivers on them.</p>

<p>I’ve never been to any third world Asian country before, so the idea of seeing roads dominated by scooters and motorcycles was really a foreign concept to me.  This also meant that the style of driving is way different.  There is plenty of honking, mostly as a way to say “I’m here” and nothing more.  I didn’t really see anyone get upset because they were being honked at here - nothing like things might be in New York, for instance.</p>

<p>Another scary thing is they way drivers are not afraid to overtake each other.  Wherever we went we took taxis or larger vans.  Our drivers would often pass slower motorcycles even when it wasn’t 100% clear on the other side, since they could effectively used the middle of the road, with motorcycles in each direction on the sides.</p>

<p>It was often scary, especially when it was rainy and late at night, when our tour driver needed to get back in a hurry.</p>

<p>In any case, we survived.  So enjoy this video of one of the calmer moments in Lombok.  Keep an eye out for the horse and buggy.  No idea what that’s all about - maybe they keep it around for the tourists?</p>

<p>(I wrote this one a few weeks back but didn’t post the pics until now, so here it is in its complete form!).</p>

<p>I’ve been here in Japan for a month and in true form haven’t provided much in the way of updates since then.  Doh.</p>

<p>Here’s a catch-up post, with plenty of pictures and videos to keep things interesting.</p>

<p>Spring in Japan again!  I was really happy to use jetlag to my advantage and wake up super early while staying in Kyoto, where I was able to walk over to a few areas that turned out to be almost empty, but were sure to get crowded later.  I’ve found that this trick always works if you’re willing to wake up early enough - this also worked for Yosemite, a place as crowded as Disneyland.  Except the trick there was to wake up before dawn…</p>

<p>Anyhow, I really felt that one stroll through the fairly empty Path of Philosophy early in the morning was enough to satisfy me for the entire trip.  I felt super happy, and was lucky to get some video of a fairly empty Path of Philosophy, around 7am or so.</p>

<p>With every passing hour it was noticeably getting more crowded, so my plan from there was to escape and head down for a walk along the Kamo river (Kamogawa), which is big enough that it never feels super crowded.  It was also a good chance to revisit old favorite cafes like efish.  Can’t beat Kyoto coffee culture!</p>

<p>After this I realized that I was pretty satisfied, and maybe even burnt out on crowds.  I really felt like getting out if Kyoto, so I cancelled some hotels (with 100% refund, really easy to do when you book through Expedia).  I realized that I got really burned out on tourists a lot sooner than I hoped.  Knowing full well that I myself am a tourist of course, and that I’m contributing to the problem…</p>

<p>But this burnout happened to have good timing.  I found out that Yuka was briefly headed to China for work, so it was a good time to activate my weeklong JR Pass and do something I’ve always wanted to do: abuse it as much as possible, traveling as far in one direction as I could.  I always thought it would be fun to travel north to Hokkaido by shinkansen, and by good coincidence it turns out this wasn’t possible until the end of this March this year, when a stretch of track was just opened that went all the way to Hakodate.  My eventual goal was to arrive at Sapporo by shinkansen, but that final stretch is still being constructed.  But no worries, there was an express train there instead.</p>

<p>On the first day of my JR Pass adventure, I made an escape from Kyoto and headed northeast.  I only stopped briefly in Tokyo to change shinkansen trains, then I was off again to Furukawa, a sleepy town just north of Sendai.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lff7ZQff8uE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I’d randomly chosen to stop here before on a previous trip and enjoyed the slower pace.  The town itself doesn’t really have much to offer, but that’s ok.  I also knew that hotels were super cheap all around northern Japan - about 5000 yen ($45) for a decent business hotel with a good breakfast included.  I could definitely stretch my money a lot further compared to more expensive and touristy places like Kyoto.  I discovered a good business hotel chain there: Hotel Route Inn, which seems to serve all of northern Japan.</p>

<p>The next leg of the trip was from Furukawa to Hakodate, a small town in Hokkaido.  Being in Hokkaido, this means the shinkansen ran out of land and would either have to go over or under the water to get to the island of Hokkaido.  Disappointingly, it turned out to be under water: vast stretches of the trip that were in boring tunnels.  I suppose the option to build a bridge would’ve provided a beautiful sight for passengers, at the expense of a maintenance nightmare, as this would mean repair crews would have to battle the harsh winters, exposed out on a bridge over the ocean.  I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the eventual Hakodate to Sapporo track will be underground for the same reason.</p>

<p>Hakodate was nice, although the touted night view from Mt. Hakodate was overcrowded with tourists.  Especially Chinese tourists for some reason.  I think the night view of city by the sea, with mountains in the background, is hard to beat.  It’s worth seeing once though.</p>

<p>The last leg of the journey was from Hakodate to Sapporo on an express train.  Not quite a shinkansen, so the trip covered comparatively little ground, but the train was nice and was setup nicely inside with assigned seats, tray tables for food, nice storage areas.  It was an express train trying its hardest to be a shinkansen.</p>

<p>I didn’t mind the comparative slowness of this express train actually: the countryside here was probably the most beautiful part of the trainride, with ocean views and interesting forests and mountains with interesting shapes in the distance.</p>

<p>One thing that did surprise me about this stretch was that although the view of the ocean water very near the track was beautiful, there were vast stretches where pieces of trash had washed up on shore.  There must’ve been thousands of fishing baubles and other random debris washed up there.  I wondered to myself if it had always been like that, or if it was lingering trash from the tsunami five years before?  Maybe no one cared about cleaning it up because these towns were out in the middle of nowhere.  It is a shame though, since so much trash could be seen from the train.  I would think even JR (the train company) might have an incentive to sponsor a beachside cleanup, to beautify the view for its passengers along this stretch?</p>

<p>I finally made it to Sapporo and stayed for two nights.  It’s a big city but doesn’t feel overcrowded like other Japanese cities.  Maybe because it was freezing outside - literally.  There was sleet and snow while I was walking around - very strong bursts at times.  I didn’t plan well for this - all I had packed that would help against this was a windbreaker.</p>

<p>It became too cold and soon it became clear I needed to take a building-by-building strategy, from heated building to another heated building.</p>

<p>Canon photo gallery?  Ok why not, I like Canon.  And it’s warm.  When I eventually left, I made it a block or two until I got too cold, and saw the next building to go into.</p>

<p>A bookstore?  Oh sure, I like books.  And it’s warm.  Oh, I forget that I’m illiterate here.  English books are hard to find…</p>

<p>Ok, exit and walk another block through the sleet.  7-11?  Hmm sure, I’m sure I could buy some random junkfood or something there.  And it’s warm there.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-sapporo-711-snow.jpg" width="666" height="892" title="A Sapporo 7-11 while it started snowing.  I definitely stepped into this 7-11 for some warm comfort." /><figcaption>A Sapporo 7-11 while it started snowing.  I definitely stepped into this 7-11 for some warm comfort.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Walk a little further and see a Tully’s Coffee. Ok why not, I like coffee.  And it’s warm.</p>

<p>Eventually I realized that having some insulation would be nice, if even for the day or two I was up there.  I found some department stores, but the clothes were either too strange and peculiarly Japanese (and too small), or too foreign and therefore expensive.  $700 jacket from Henry Cottens Italy?  No thanks, that’s more than I’m paying for rent here in Osaka (my rent is 50000 yen, less than $500).</p>

<p>I settled for some long underwear and undershirt from Uniqlo, then put them on in a bathroom.  Now I could go out and take pictures in the snow!</p>

<p>But unfortunately I kind of squandered my opportunity to take interesting snowy city pictures of Sapporo.  I was walking around all day with my 24mm lens, which is a difficult focal length to work with.  Should’ve probably stuck with my trusty 50mm.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-04-26-sapporo-ramen.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Delicious Sapporo ramen" /><figcaption>Delicious Sapporo ramen</figcaption></figure>

<p>On this trip I also learned to pack a bit smarter.  On previous trips I’d brought a massive suitcase and packed way too much stuff.  I remember one longterm trip where I’d packed a flatbed photo scanner, just because I could really.  And I thought I needed it, to scan forms that I needed to sign or something.  I’m still not entirely sure what I was thinking.</p>

<p>I guess way back then I learned that packing a massive suitcase was somewhat doable but a real hassle, especially when transporting it from place to place.  For instance, when traveling on the shinkansen you can only hope that there’s space at the back of the traincar to store the suitcase.  There’s some limited space there, and it turns out not to be an issue, but it’s far more convenient to have multiple bags which can be broken down and stored in the overhead compartment (kinda like an airplane, but uncovered), which is what I did this trip.</p>

<p>Another hassle of super large bags is that they can only be stored in super large coin lockers, which are hard to find and more limited.  Also, good luck trying to find one during this time of year, which is the most popular time to visit…</p>

<p>Anyhow, the moral of the story is that on this trip I traveled smarter.  Of course the less the better, so I think I could definitely improve it still.</p>

<p>See the interactive <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/2016-01-31-big-basin-hike.html">GPS track log here</a>.</p>

<p>I really needed to get out of Silicon Valley again and go experience nature, so on Sunday I drove over to my favorite hiking spot, Big Basin.  There’s a $10 fee to get in and park, but it’s worth it considering it’s about the price of a movie and much more rewarding.</p>

<p>I arrived right after the park opened and started my hike to Berry Creek Falls at 8:20am, which is probably the earliest I’ve started there.  Today was a bit difficult because of the recent rains: much of the trail was very muddy, and I found myself stopping a few times to try to work out the best path through the mud.</p>

<p>And yes, I fell down into the mud.  At least three times.</p>

<p>What was maybe more alarming was the fact that on the way to Berry Creek falls there were multiple newly-fallen trees that were blocking the path.  In one case a tree had completely destroyed a bridge, and I had to find a way over or under the tree.  I unded up going over, walking along the slippery log and then working my way to the other side.  I tried making my way down slowly instead of jumping, which was a bad choice - I grabbed onto a piece of the decaying tree, but it broke off and I slid down a bit…</p>

<p>I made it to Berry Creek Falls, where I’d been before a few years back.  There was a lot more water gushing down the falls this time!</p>

<p>I felt up for it, so I decided to continue the hike on the Berry Creek Falls trail, saw a few more waterfalls I’d never seen before, and then met up with the Sunset Trail, which I took back to the park headquarters, making it about a 11 mile loop.  Started at 8:20am, took some breaks and a lunch stop at Golden Cascade Falls, then finally made it back to my car around 2:20pm.</p>

<p>I definitely brought back lots of mud with me!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve seen Casablanca more than a few times, and it’s become one of my favorite films.  For this review I got to experience it in 35mm at the wonderful nearby Stanford Theatre.</p>

<p>But that’s not how I first experienced it.  I first watched it at home and half paid attention to it.  A lot of the movie was lost on me and I thought it was overrated, just ok, and not that great.  My views have changed, in case you haven’t guessed.</p>

<p>It does seem to be a film that takes repeated viewings to “get”.  The script is brilliant, every line has its place.  If you look away for a few scenes you may miss some clever back and forth that’s worth watching again to catch.</p>

<p>The pacing is mostly great and still holds up well for modern audiences.  I struggled to find a scene that I could get up for popcorn for.  Every scene had classic lines that I didn’t want to miss.</p>

<p>This film is chock full of classic one-liners that have become part of our culture in their own rite really.  It’s through the love of this film that that’s even made possible.</p>

<p>This is a film that is best experienced, not explained in a post like this.  However, that being said, I’ll give this a try anyhow.</p>

<p>I’ve avoided this film all my life out of dread more than anything.  It’s somewhat weird then that I watched this so early in my “Top 100” films quest.  I knew I’d have to watch it eventually anyhow.</p>

<p>Everyone who has seen this said it’s a good movie but is very depressing and dark.  Not that we’d expect anything less from a movie about the grim realities about the Holocaust.</p>

<p>I came into the movie already knowing that I’d see many people die in gruesome ways, and that I’d see the Nazis misbehaving.  But maybe I’m a bit desensitized.  I’ve seen Nazis act in outrageous ways in movies and videogames all my life.  That familiar Nazi outrageousness, oozing evil, does appear in Schindler’s List.  But here it’s factually grounded, which makes it eerie.  In this movie there is little in the way of an exaggeration - all of these things did happen.</p>

<p>He appears completely out of control, as he indiscriminately shoots down prisoner Jews like he’s hunting deer.  Or more precisely, shooting fish in a barrel.  I want to somehow think this is a fiction, that this is the product of an overzealous writer looking for new ways to portray Nazis as outrageously evil.  But I look up Goeth and find that he exists, and that he did exact what he is portrayed doing.  That is somehow surprising to me.  I desperately wanted his random shooting to be a work of fiction.</p>

<p>This is a movie that knows how to use extreme contrast to bring focus on things.  It has a few scenes in color, but most of the movie takes place in black and white.  The black and white scenes sometimes include very selective color: the famous girl in a red jacket and the color in the flames of burning candles.</p>

<p>Schindler picks out a girl in a red coat in the chaos of the liquidation of the ghetto.  He later sees the corpse of the girl that’s been exhumed, to be put on the giant pile of bodies in a mass incineration.</p>

<p>It’s here that he really shows vulnerability as a character.  He loses his cool exterior and is shocked.  He realizes he needs to do something.  He needs to take action.</p>

<p>It’s here that he creates a list that the movie takes its namesake from.  This is a list of Jews that he will bribe officials to keep at his factory, and keep them safe and away.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-12-oskar-schindler-and-itzhak-stern.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="Schindler and Stern drawing up a list." /><figcaption>Schindler and Stern drawing up a list.</figcaption></figure>

<p>One part that really resonated with me was the misfortune of a group of women who were on Schindler’s List - the ones who I knew should be protected.  The killing in general is a horrible thing during the film, but it’s a fact and I prepared myself somewhat for it.  When Schindler drew up his list of those he would protect, I became invested in their well-being, because I know they had been chosen to be kept safe.  Somehow I found myself empathizing with them more.</p>

<p>So all the more the shock when a traincar of women who were on his list somehow was diverted to the wrong place.  The train pulls into an eerily familiar-looking courtyard.  We don’t need to be told where this is, but the film lets us know anyway: Auschwitz.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-13-auschwitz-train-arrival.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="The train arrives at Auschwitz." /><figcaption>The train arrives at Auschwitz.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Auschwitz.  Some of the protected Schindler Jews ended up at Auschwitz?!</p>

<p>What’s worse - they have heard secondhand stories of mass gassings, and they find themselves going through the motions through which what appears to be the same process.  They undress and are herded into the showers.  This could be their end.  But they were on the list - they were the ones that weren’t supposed to die in this movie, right??</p>

<p>But it’s just water, not gas.  A huge relief for the entire group, as naked and helpless as they still are.</p>

<p>There is also extreme contrast in Schindler himself.  Throughout the movie he is nothing but a smooth character who maintains control and appears to exert control, even when briefly tossed into prison for kissing a Jew.  But this smooth exterior vanishes at the end when he accepts the gift of a ring and starts trembling so much that he drops the ring.  His reaction is almost out of character, because his facade breaks down.  He realizes he could have sold even more of his possessions to save a few more lives, on top of the 1100 lives he has already saved.</p>

<p>The end of the film has an artful transition into the current day, with the real remaining Schindler Jews at the time paying their respects to Schinder’s grave.</p>

<p>Of course this is a film that needs to be seen by all for historical reasons and also for future reasons.  We don’t want a repeat of anything like these events, and this film alone convinces viewers of that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-title-card.jpg" width="1000" height="729" title="IKIRU, 生きる, TO LIVE" /><figcaption>IKIRU, 生きる, TO LIVE</figcaption></figure>

<p>This is an existentialist story about a man who learns he has stomach cancer, leading to his reconsidering of life, which he realizes has been utterly wasted up until this point.</p>

<p>As it turns out, he realizes he hasn’t really been living at all.  What’s inadvertently happened is that his job has turned into his life - the job of being section chief at one of the endless wasteful government bureaucracies.  From the point of his diagnosis, his challenge is trying, in the brief life he has left, to figure out what it means to actually live.  Thus the name of the film in English: TO LIVE.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-dark-lighting.jpg" width="1000" height="732" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>This is a sad and deeply disturbing film, not disturbing in the explicit sense of a horror or a war movie, but disturbing because these are the horrors of everyday life.  It is too real: the horror of mundane office life, of government bureaucracy, of the disconnect between life and work, of a cancer slowly eating away at remaining life, of life’s clock itself ticking down, chiming each hour closer to death.  The horror of growing old and losing vitality and life’s energy.</p>

<p>In the very opening of the film, a group of women is petitioning a government agency to turn a cesspool into a children’s park and playground.  In typical government fashion, the responsibility is pushed from department to department, with no one department wanting to take responsibility.  Thus the park becomes a pretty clearly established MacGuffin.</p>

<p>The protagonist - Kenji Watanabe - has been diagnosed with stomach cancer, but is initially alone in his discomfort, with no one close or trusting enough to help him.  Even the doctors themselves are distrustful, as they don’t directly tell him his diagnosis - Watanabe has to find out indirectly.  After his diagnosis he walks outside of the hospital and we get the sense that he no longer belongs in the world - the busy street with with cars speeding by is in a sense life itself passing by - something that is now very alien.</p>

<p>It’s a world in which he no longer belongs.</p>

<p>He’s an outcast at work, the boring boss figurehead who’s probably in his position based on seniority alone.  He’s also an outcast at home, where his wife died many years ago, and where he now lives with his ungrateful and highly dislikable son and his son’s girlfriend.  He reflects on his life which was devoted to his son, and wants to break the news of his cancer to him.  He looks for various ways to tell him.  But the son has turned his back on him and effectively blocks him out.</p>

<p>There’s no one close enough for Watanabe to break the news to.  The first person he tells is a complete stranger at a bar, an apparently alcoholic struggling writer.  Watanabe eventually confesses that he wants to learn how to live life, and asks the writer to help him spend his money all at once, while he still has time.  The writer refuses his money and instead offers to pay with his own money, which immediately makes him the first character Watanabe can trust.  They go out and visit all the vices of nightlife in the city: booze, clubs, loud bars, crowded dance halls, stripteases.</p>

<p>They find themselves at a club with a piano player playing a boogie-woogie tune which people are energetically dancing to.  People dancing, full of life.</p>

<p>Watanabe requests an old song which gives away his age: the hit of 1915, Gondola no Uta (ゴンドラの唄, “The Gondola Song”).  People try to dance to it, but he sings in such a depressing way that is a downer for everyone there.  The camera pulls back from the face of the writer, whose thin and pale face is baring his lower teeth, and his whole appearing perhaps not coincidentally resembling a skeleton, utterly in shock.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-singing-2.jpg" width="1000" height="729" title="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>The night ends with a taxiride home with some revolting and annoying prostitutes.  Watanabe has to get the taxi to stop so he can vomit on the sidewalk.  It’s the reminder of his stomach ulcer, a problem that cannot be drunk away.</p>

<p>But it turns out these places aren’t what Watanabe is looking for.  The day after, he roams the streets continuing to look, and by chance runs into a young girl from work.  A girl that is still very full of life, as revealed by her innocent full smile.  A girl that doesn’t belong at Watanabe’s workplace, and is consequently quitting.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-smiling-girl.jpg" width="1000" height="732" title="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>Back home, the son has blocked him out with his newspaper, and the son’s girlfriend with her knitting and furtive glances.  They are so resistant and are unable to listen.  They think he’s having a relationship with the young girl from the office, and accuse without even listening to Watanabe.</p>

<p>Watanabe meets with the girl one last time, and finally confesses that he has cancer and not long to live, and that his life has been a waste.  He confesses that the girl brings out some life still remaining in him.</p>

<p>The girl is now working at a factory making toy bunnies, and she explains how she feels as if by making the toys she’s reaching out to all the children across the Japan.  She has found a workplace where she belongs.  She has found meaning in her work.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-rabbit.jpg" width="1000" height="785" title="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>“Why don’t you try making something too?” she says.</p>

<p>And then his haunting reply: “It’s too late.”</p>

<p>But soon after he appears to have a realization.  He leaves the girl and walks straight out of the restaurant, with a clear and definitely purpose.  It’s the last we see of the girl - she’s served her purpose in showing him the way.  “Happy birthday to you” is playing for a young girl as Watanabe is exiting the scene, but it’s really his birthday, or rather his rebirth.</p>

<p>“Happy birthday to you” plays again as Watanabe goes out to personally inspect the future park site - this becomes his life goal.  The challenge that no government agency wanted to take on.</p>

<p>Then the scene cuts to five months later.  Suddenly Watanabe is dead.</p>

<p>This is the climax of the film, which happens at a somewhat unusual place.  The rest of the story is told through his funeral and flashbacks.  This is really my only complaint with the movie - we have to spend the rest of the movie in a room with people we’ve grown to dislike and distrust.  Coworkers, bureaucrats, and the uncaring son and girlfriend.  The bureaucrats continue bureaucrating, and try to take credit for building Watanabe’s park, an effort they all quickly turned down at the beginning of the film.</p>

<p>Then very briefly, some people we trust and care about: the group of women originally petitioning for the park arrive and mourn very intently at Watanabe’s altar, an act of sincerity which inadvertently shames the insincere bickering bureaucrats.</p>

<p>Then we return to the room of people we dislike, and we are forced to spend more time with these unlikeable characters.  Because of this I think this part just drags on much longer than needed, and slows down the pacing of the film.  But then there is some redemption: some of the bureaucrats finally acknowledge Watanabe’s efforts, and they appear to be themselves inspired and changed.</p>

<p>We also get flashbacks of Watanabe stubbornly running up against challenge after challenge to get the park built, even in the face of gangsters, presumably the Yakuza, who showed him leniency.  I think this is worth showing briefly, but it’s already been strongly established that this government is a very inefficient and resistant to change, so much of this seems like unnecessary storyline that makes the film drag.</p>

<p>However, all this waiting and slow pacing leads to a worthwhile payoff: the policeman stopping by the funeral to return Watanabe’s hat and pay his respects.  He’s the one that recounts the very beautiful scene with Watanabe singing his Gondola Song on a swing in his new park, amidst falling fresh snow.  That’s the last we see of Watanabe alive, and how truly alive and happy he was.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-swing-playground-in-the-snow-1.jpg" width="1000" height="785" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>The film ends with a strong hint that some coworkers’ attitudes and behaviors have now been changed by Watanabe, and that his efforts have affected more change than just the children’s playground.  His actions have really lead to a greater good in the world.</p>

<p>This has become one of my favorite films, for the very reason that it’s a challenge to how we should live.  This is how art and how films can improve our lives and make us better people - they involve us in a world and let us learn from the characters in that world.  And from this film is the challenge calling out clearly: live your life, create, don’t waste your life, do good through your work.</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/a-journey-through-the-top-100-films/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-05T09:26:33-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/a-journey-through-the-top-100-films</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s the beginning of January, which means the beginning of a new year.  And you know what that means - a time for making resolutions that will probably not be kept!  Well, let’s see how far this one goes…</p>

<p>Instead of wasting away my time playing video games, I’ve decided to take a bit more seriously another passion: watching movies.  I’m going to try to make this constructive by reviewing each of the top 100 movies, many of which I’ll be sitting down and watching for the very first time, and many of which are old favorites that I’ll be rewatching, unfortunately not with fresh eyes.</p>

<p>This should be completely doable, as this comes out to watching roughly 2 movies a week.  The part I expect to be time-consuming are the reviews for each film, which I want to be worthwhile to read, with screenshots and such, to keep the readers’ eyes stimulated between the walls of text I’m sure to write.</p>

<h2 id="selecting-the-100">Selecting the 100</h2>
<p>My method for selecting the top 100 movies is to take the unweighted <a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/title?count=100&amp;groups=top_250&amp;sort=user_rating">highest rated films on IMDB</a> and filter out anything from the last 15 years, meaning that all of these films will be pre-2000.</p>

<p>This may seem pretty arbitrary to some folks, but if you’ve watched the IMDB rankings for any period of time you’ll notice new movies have a tendency to show up high in the rankings for a brief period before falling lower over time.  My guess here is that time is a sort of sieve, and as such it takes time for the sieve to filter these newer movies.  But I can sort of speed up that process by jumping back 15 years (because 2000 is a nice round number), to movies that the sieve has had time to work on.</p>

<p>The more recent films are also in our more recent collective conscious - you can see this reflected in the distribution of films by decade below.</p>

<p>Also, this somewhat avoids the type of film rankings where Citizen Kane always shows up as #1, and most of the pre-1980 classics seem to have strong preference over anything recent.</p>

<p>See the interactive <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/2015-10-25-big-basin-hike.html">GPS track log here</a>.</p>

<p>On Sunday I grabbed two sandwiches at Le Boulanger, and headed for a late hike in Big Basin, which is my favorite place to hike in the area.  The drive from my apartment in Sunnyvale is almost an hour and a half, and the fee to park is $10, but it’s worth it to go and spend time there once and a while.</p>

<p>I’ve found I can usually find parking very easily at the very end of North Escape Road, near the camping area, which ends up being a much more secluded start to the hike.  Starting from there you can immediately cross over the river and then see the site of the Maddock Homestead right across the river.</p>

<p>From there I traveled up north along the Skyline to the Sea trail, pretty much going as far as I could before sunset, when the trails close.  I got back just as it was getting tough to see with the unaided eye.</p>

<p>Along the way I saw a TON of ladybugs um.. how should I say this.. in the process of making a TON more ladybugs.  I didn’t have my macro lens with me, but I’m tempted to go back just for more of these pictures.  I’ve never seen anything like this before!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Andre: OK. Yes, we are bored. We’re all bored now. But has it ever occurred to you, Wally, that the process that creates this boredom that we see in the world now may very well be a self-perpetuating, unconscious form of brainwashing, created by a world totalitarian government based on money, and that all of this is much more dangerous than one thinks?  And it’s not just a question of individual survival Wally, but that somebody who’s bored is asleep, and somebody who’s asleep will not say no?<br />From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRBZDmf1jSw">My Dinner With Andre</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless I die young, I haven’t quite made it to my midlife crisis yet.  But it does seem to me that I’ve heard more and more about people experiencing their “quarter-life” crises.  Is this something new?  Or have people always had so many of these doubting periods?  Or maybe we’re at a time where so many of us have the freedom and luxury to even contemplate such a thing, a freedom that leads to our own detriment.</p>

<p>I’m admittedly not great at math, but it does seem to me these quarter-life crises should occur in someone’s early 20’s.  Is that crisis somehow supposed to eventually pass, or just it just get quietly ignored while we distract ourselves with other concerns?  Then we learn to get comfortably numb and sleepy and learn to accept life for how mundane it really is?  Can a midlife crisis still re-emerge later on in life, after a person wakes up again?</p>

<p>I’m fairly certain I’ve been asleep these past few years.  I wouldn’t be surprised, since I do like to sleep (I sometimes waste entire weekends on the couch or in bed, but that’s another story).</p>

<p>I’m too old for these childish quarter-life crises.  The only explanation for this current one is that I must’ve graduated to the rarely-if-ever-mentioned third-life crisis.  A relevant question to ask myself here: just how many damn life crises is it normal for someone to have, and do they ever stop?</p>

<p>In my 20’s I graduated college, had a choice of career paths and started to float and drift a bit, getting a job testing cellphone games.  There I made some friends, but it didn’t really advance my career or my personal life outside of that.</p>

<p>I got older, I worked more, I got a job at a big corporate job, doing what I thought was a decent career.  But I learned that big corporate jobs are soul-numbing.  I quit my big corporate job and did the inevitable clichéd trip to Asia.  Particularly in my field, folks seem to get the same idea.  (Not unlike other things I suppose: Everyone wants to travel to Asia, everyone wants to move to Portland or Austin, everyone wants to save up for a house, everyone wants a Tesla).</p>

<p>That experience traveling helped me grow as a person more than any job ever did, but apparently I didn’t grow or learn enough, because I found myself falling into the same pattern as before.  Get the comfortable corporate job, dance like a monkey if I wanted to advance and get promoted, then try to save up for a house like everyone else.</p>

<p>The idiotic Silicon Valley version: save up for a down payment on a ridiculously overpriced house that’s in the bad part of town and also falling apart (because that’s the only one you can afford making comparative chump change to everyone else).  Maybe also save up for a Tesla, so at the very least you can brag to your coworkers that you bought a Tesla.  Because Tesla.</p>

<p>Then you get a job at what’s supposed to be the Best Place To Work In The Universe, according to a survey of all known workers in the universe.  You find that it’s not too much different than your previous Big Corporate Job.  Is this really all there is to look forward to?  So I can buy a house and a Tesla?  What next after that even?  Work the rest of the best years of my life paying off the house?</p>

<p>What if I don’t want a house (though not sharing walls would be nice)?  What if I don’t want a Tesla?  I don’t think I’m the only one.  I think all those folks who quit their jobs to travel the world likely have the same feelings.  They’re trying to escape from something.  Their inner selves seem to have woken up from a nightmare in the night, and are restlessly awake, pacing back and forth.  Except they’re pacing through the world, not just their bedrooms.</p>

<p>Some of these folks even get the idea that the ideal lifestyle is being a traveling nomad, hopping from country to country, somehow earning enough money to get by.  If they can make it work, I think they do tend to be happier, or at least more alive and more childlike and inquisitive.  Is it just the permanent change in scenery?  I’m not sure I’d be comfortable in that sort of lifestyle myself.  It is always nice to come back home eventually, and to spend time with familiar friends and family, and familiar things in general.  Sometimes it’s nice to be a little hobbit-like.</p>

<p>Is all this travelling and escaping just a delaying of inevitable adulthood?  What if I’m already an adult - does it mean I’m just deceiving myself?  Am I running away from myself?  Is adulthood really just the acceptance that you’re not special, that this really is the only thing life is about?  That your life is the thing that happens for a few brief hours after work, and entire weekends that you may end up wasting on stupid pursuits?</p>

<p>As much as philosophy has helped me, in cases like this I think it’s kind of made me dissatisfied with everything.</p>

<p>Maybe I can still somehow play and enjoy the game of life, even if I realize it’s only some silly game we’ve concocted to keep ourselves busy?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’d been looking for a night like tonight for a long time, when the new moon fell squarely on the weekend.  The only problem: unpredictable weather!</p>

<p>I drive about an hour and a half south on the 101 and then the 25 to head towards the east Pinnacles entrance, which I’d never been at before.  I also chatted with Yuka over LINE for a bit of it, at least until the reception got bad and dropped the call about ten minutes beofre getting to the park.</p>

<p>In any case, I made past the folks camping nearby, to the wide open dirt parking lot.  I rolled down my window, and stuck my head out the window to look up at the sky.  Wait, what sky?  It turned out to be clouds.  100% clouds.</p>

<p>The forecast said it would be partly cloudy, which has sometimes meant 10% clouds whereas other times…  Well, I guess this fell into the “other times” category.</p>

<p>Just proves that you can’t win them all, and you can’t plan everything.  Sometimes you just have to travel a lot and occassionally get lucky.</p>

<p>Like the time the moon was rising straight over the road behind me on the way to my parents’ house in Big Bear, but I didn’t have my camera stuff ready in time.  That would’ve been an awesome shot, but now it’s an awesome memory.</p>

<p>Or the time I drove up Whitney Portal Road to get a shot of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/franksvalli/13234418335">the snow-covered mountains that you could see visibly glowing under the moonlight</a>.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>

<p>Last night I attended an impromptu star party in Yosemite attended by only one person total.  The sky was really clear, and the Milky Way was very easy to see with camera and the eye.</p>

<p>While taking some photos around 3:30am or so, I saw a bright satellite trawl across the sky.  It was quite bright - maybe an Iridium flare?</p>

<p>My eyes started to track it across the sky, but it almost looked like it was dancing instead of advancing steadily.  It was going stop-go but very smoothly.</p>

<p>At this point I should mention that I’d drank much more coffee than I really should have, in preparation for the long drive.  Despite all the coffee I was getting very tired, which made for a bad combination with driving.</p>

<p>I think the dancing of the satellite was due to the effects of the coffee, that or it was just a natural optical illusion.</p>

<p>The satellite went behind some trees, and soon after that I saw a very bright star emerge over the mountains on the other side of the trees.</p>

<p>Must be a UFO!</p>

<p>I looked at the star intently, and could swear I could see it dancing as well, though a bit more stationary.  It was also changing colors - red, blue, white.  Obviously a very patriotic UFO.</p>

<p>My delirium-fueled excitement was pushing me to get out my super telephoto, which is exactly what I did.  Here I with the perfect equipment, tripod, and RAW video capabilities!  A really good UFO video to post to YouTube!</p>

<p>But nope.  Zoomed in on a tripod, it was clear it was a fairly stationary star, only moving progressively with the backdrop of the other stars in Yosemite’s real-life planetarium.</p>

<p>It was clear it was time to head to bed.  Who knows what else I’d start seeing after a while…</p>

<p>Parked somewhere in a gravel parking lot near Camp Curry and slept in my car (whoohoo for being single and getting to save money).</p>

<p>It was around 4am when I was finally getting to sleep.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Note: partial notes)</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I’ve been trying to get more into Eastern/Western Philosophy comparisons lately, and I’ve subscribed to an interesting journal out of the University of Hawaii called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_East_and_West/">Philosophy East and West</a>.</p>

<p>This is however somewhat of a challenge.</p>

<p>This spirit of comparative philosophy seems to be more popular for so-called “Continental Philosophy” rather than “Analytic Philosophy”, which makes the style and occassional references to German words somewhat unfamiliar to me.  I’m more familiar with the Western Analytic tradition, so this is a challenge trying to access something that falls into a different tradition, in more ways than one.  Western and Eastern, Analytic and Continental, and yet I’m convinced we all can learn something about everything.  (apparently Rorty tried to bridge some of these differences, but anyhow I guess I’ll have to look into that later)</p>

<p>This comparative piece from Man Li and Bart Dessein (both from Belgium’s Ghent University) is an interesting look at Eastern and Western conceptions of time as viewed by two contemporaries:</p>

<p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Aurelius Augustinus</a> (354-430), better known as Saint Augustine.<br />
-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengzhao">Sengzhao (僧肇)</a> (384–414), referred to in the text as Seng Zhao</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The scope of this article is to examine the conception of time in Augustine’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_(Augustine)">Confessions</a> and contemporary Buddhist Sengzhao’s conception in Zhao Lun (The Treatises of [Seng]zhao).</p>

<p>The question “what is time?” is a part of every philosophical tradition, and it is a question that concerns all people, from the layman to the scholar.  The question brings our mortality into question, as we ask ourselves “do our lives pass through some objective time, or is time some subjective thing that is somehow part of our bodies?”</p>

<p>For the authors of this article, the answer to this objective/subjective question also leads to bigger questions about whether humans are creators and controllers of their own lives, or rather if they are constrained by time, some outside objective thing which they cannot themselves control.</p>

<h2 id="augustines-conception-of-time">Augustine’s Conception of Time</h2>
<p>The backdrop of Augustine’s philosophy is Greek philosophy, which had viewed the mythological cosmos as an eternal cycle, and consequently a view of time as a cyclical process.  Herodotos, Thukydides (Thucydides), and even Plato were responsible for shifting focus from this cyclical mythological view of time to a more human view.</p>

<p>Human life, and human history, is inevitably interlaced with time.  And since the (cyclical) divine withdrew from (temporal) human life, humans now have the  creative freedom to create meaning for themselves and society, in a sort of existentialist way.  For these thinkers, to understand it’s crucial to understand temporal human life constrasted with the permanent cosmos, and that human life (and “human time”) is somewhat unique in the way it breaks free of the eternal cycle.</p>

<p>With Augustine, Christianity’s introduction into this sort of world necessarily has an effect and changes the way these things are perceived, including our conception of time.</p>

<p>For Augustine, there are two senses time: an objective and subjective time.</p>

<h3 id="augustines-objective-time">Augustine’s Objective Time</h3>
<p>An old Manichean question helps us understand here: “What was God doing before He created heaven and earth?”.  The answer is that this question is essentially nonsensical, because time is also a created thing, like heaven and earth.  Time was created simulatanously with all other created things.  Essentially, there was no “before” or “after” without the existence of other created things.</p>

<p>There are a few key relationships here in this objective sense of time.  In regards to God and time, God is independent of time.  In regards to Heaven/Earth and their relationship to time, they are all created things, and in a sense are all equally infinite.  Regarding created things and time, this is a question of time and all finite things - that is, all that is non-God, non-Heaven, and non-Earth.  All these things are subject to time, including Heaven and Earth.</p>

<h3 id="augustines-subjective-time">Augustine’s Subjective Time</h3>
<p>In Augustine’s subjective definition, time is an extension of the mind - that is to say, when we measure time we are measuring our <em>impression</em> of time.  There is no way for us to get ahold of the objective essence of time.  That is to say, time in itself.  “Either this impression is time, otherwise I do not measure time”.</p>

<p>(my note: there’s a much larger related discussion behind this, of phenomenology)</p>

<p>We have an idea of past, present, and future, but really we are speaking of our “present impression” of all three.  When we speak of the past, we do not have direct access to it, only to a present impression of the past.  Likewise when we speak of the future: what we’re really grasping at is our present impression of the future.  Past, present, and future, all three concepts are present impressions in the mind.</p>

<h2 id="sengzhaos-conception-of-time">Sengzhao’s Conception of Time</h2>
<p>Sengzhao’s philosophy of time is influenced by Buddhist philosophy of his day, which viewed time as a mechanical process, not influenced by the divine as in Augustine’s conception.</p>

<p>In this karmic mechanical time model, time is the infinite cycle of rebirths (samsara), a process of exchanging one life for another.</p>

<p>According to the Vaibhāṣika school, all three time periods must exist, for if they didn’t then there would be no karmic chain, or chain of causality of past influencing present, and present influencing the future.</p>

<p>In this view there is also somewhat of a subjective notion of time, in the sense that an individual has their own alottment of time.  This time can be controlled if the individual can stop the karmic process, and in a sense “stop time”.</p>

<h3 id="voidness-and-time">Voidness and “Time”</h3>
<p>The Madhyamaka school’s (Mahayana Buddhism) criticism of the Vaibhāṣika school is that the following premises cannot be held simulateneously:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A human being is composed of five constituents</li>
  <li>A human being has no self-nature</li>
</ol>

<p>The flow of reasoning here becomes tricky.</p>

<p>For Madhyamikas, the nature of the contituents (dharma) must be the same as the nature of things formed by them (since like comes from like).  If there is a self-nature, the constituents must also have the same self-nature, but they cannot.  Therefore they are as void (sunya) as the things formed by them are.  But time cannot be “in” things that are void, so time must not be “in” things.</p>

<p>If time is not a part of things, then we have two possibilities left:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Either time exists independently of things</li>
  <li>Things pass through an independently-existing time</li>
</ol>

<p>This is where Seng Zhao comes into play.</p>

<p>In Zhao’s texts, there is no direct discussion of the word that translates as “time”, but he does present dual concepts:</p>

<p>-past and present<br />
-going and coming<br />
-shifting and abiding<br />
-motion and quietude (the key pair, as they are the most used in the texts)</p>

<p>According to Zhao, there are two ways of perceiving time (or the moving of things):</p>

<ol>
  <li>The ordinary way, a sort of conventional truth</li>
  <li>The superior way, in the domain of absolute truth</li>
</ol>

<p>According to the ordinary way of thinking about things, if there is no motion then there is quietude (these are the pairs of concepts mentioned above).  But according to Zhao, motion and quietude have never been different - one is not the absence of another, for it’s possible to have quietude even despite motion.</p>

<p>There’s a key thought behind this into the nature of things.  Zhao’s thought is that quietude cannot be the result of abandoning motion, because this would mean the fundamental nature of the thing changed.  Things must fundamentally remain the same, or else they would be different.  That is to say, something in motion should also have a nature of quietude, even while in motion.</p>

<p>There is therefore a co-existence of motion (dong) and quietude (jing).</p>

<p>These concepts of dong and jing turn out to be roughly analogous to past (xi) and present (jin).</p>

<p>On my last trip to Yosemite, I tagged along with my friends Kevin and Mari.  The first day we hiked in rain to the base of Upper Yosemite Falls.  By the second day, we were tired and looking for something quick and relaxing to do before driving back.</p>

<p>We decided to check out the Sugar Pine Railroad, which was right next to their hotel.</p>

<p>I remember passing by the railroad when I went to Yosemite with Yuka, and she seemed really excited to check it out.  Regrettably we didn’t have any time on that trip, and I sort of dismissed it as a tourist trap.</p>

<p>Yep, it’s a tourist trap.  But it’s historical and interesting, and it was fun to relax and take a ride on the old steam engine.</p>

<p>On the last stretch of the journey, there was a bunch of steam that came out of the side of the railroad.  I don’t really understand the reason for this - to let out pressure maybe?</p>

<p>Or maybe a good spectable for the tourists?  :)</p>

<p>We sat right next to the loudspeaker.  I’d advise against that.</p>
