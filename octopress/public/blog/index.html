<p>On my last trip to Yosemite, I tagged along with my friends Kevin and Mari.  The first day we hiked in rain to the base of Upper Yosemite Falls.  By the second day, we were tired and looking for something quick and relaxing to do before driving back.</p>

<p>We decided to check out the Sugar Pine Railroad, which was right next to their hotel.</p>

<p>I remember passing by the railroad when I went to Yosemite with Yuka, and she seemed really excited to check it out.  Regrettably we didn’t have any time on that trip, and I sort of dismissed it as a tourist trap.</p>

<p>Yep, it’s a tourist trap.  But it’s historical and interesting, and it was fun to relax and take a ride on the old steam engine.</p>

<p>On the last stretch of the journey, there was a bunch of steam that came out of the side of the railroad.  I don’t really understand the reason for this - to let out pressure maybe?</p>

<p>Or maybe a good spectable for the tourists?  :)</p>

<p>We sat right next to the loudspeaker.  I’d advise against that.</p>

		<p>These damn existential nights are the worst.</p>

<p>I’m tired of wasting my nights distracting myself, so I stayed at work late and went to the gym even later, then left around 10:45pm.</p>

<p>Even while exercising I could feel me asking myself nagging questions.  Why am I working out?  What’s the goal?  What’s the point of keeping your body healthy if you don’t even know where you’re going?</p>

<p>These are important questions, but not the right questions when I’m not in the mood.  I thought exercise could keep some depression at bay, but it’s still there, and there it reappears at the most inconvenient times.</p>

<p>I’m fighting it.</p>

<p>My body is getting healthier and my mind is getting stronger, and I’m slowly figuring out the path I’m going to take.</p>

<p>Sleep is the best medicine for now.</p>

				Tourist Season in Japan, and a Brief Escape to Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto</a>

<p>(I originally wrote this while sitting in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan)</p>

<p>I’m visiting Japan again, when part of me is constantly thinking I should instead be spending the time and money exploring other parts of the world.</p>

<p>I guess I just find myself coming back to the familiar and (somewhat) comfortable.  I find that I have the same habit when returning to a restaurant, and ordering the same item from the menu each and every time.  This is what I’ve always done at Roger’s, a sandwich place near where I work.  I guess this sounds kind of silly, but Japan is basically my club sandwich, the old standby which I know won’t disappoint.</p>

<p>The trouble with this is getting stuck in a rut. And if you do it too much, you may end up hating that once beloved club sandwich.</p>

<p>Thankfully, much of my previous difficulties with the language barrier have been bridged, which removes much of the frustration when traveling to Japan.</p>

<p>(However, soon after I confidently typed this, I feel like I missed a beat after ordering a second coffee - sounded like she said “osagaishimasu, ne” [a fraud, eh??] with a pause after, where I just responded by blankly staring into space and hoping it was just some typical rhetoric not requiring a reply on my part.  Oops).</p>

<p>Japan is still difficult in many ways, but now it seems most of these troubles stem from spending too much time in big cities and typical tourist destinations, which are especially crowded this time of the year.  It’s been a while since visiting Japan in the spring as a tourist, and I didn’t realize how many tourists there are here now.  Maybe there’s more than there used to be?</p>

<p>Of course this time around I’m not a student, only another tourist, so I’m contributing to the madness.</p>

<p>They are bursting out of public transportation and meandering their way through the typical attractions, and being loud in all their various languages, and staring around wide-eyed at everything, even me.  “Hey look, it’s another foreigner!” their eyes seem to say.  If Japan is your adults’ Disneyland, stare at the salarymen animatronics, not the other tourists!</p>

<p>Gaijin-to-gaijin interaction has always been really strange in Japan, like they indignantly expect something out of you.  People have written entire posts about the subject.  Perhaps I need to set aside a post of my own sometime.  Or maybe I just need to forget about it - it’s not something I have to worry about anymore.  Perhaps I never really had to truly worry about it.</p>

<p>In addition to all the western tourists, there are of course also tons of Japanese tourists from other parts of Japan, coming to enjoy the cherry blossoms.  And like everyone else, they are scrambling to snap billions of photos of the damned blossoms with their selfie-sticks and tablets and random devices.</p>

<blockquote>
&#8220;The cherries’ only fault: the crowds that gather when they bloom&#8221;
Saigyo, 12th-century poet
</blockquote>

<p>When I returned to Todaiji in Nara to see the Great Buddha, there was of course a big crowd.  I picked this day to finally try my small Glidecam, my new gadget which is great for stabilizing video.</p>

<p>Eventually I just had to sit down on one of the benches in the Great Buddha Hall and realize I was just contributing to the cameras and all the madness.  Though it was difficult to concentrate, I had to sit there for a while with my thoughts.  Something in me has changed.  All this feels different.  The childlike wonder of this place was somehow gone from me.  It’s the last feeling I wanted to feel.</p>

<p>I spent the next two days in my hotel room in Shin-Osaka.  Maybe it was depression or exhaustion, I don’t know.  I didn’t feel comfortable doing anything or interacting with anyone.</p>

<p>Last night I finally left the room and went out to a local bar to get some pizza, some comfort food I guess.  The bartenders were more than gracious and had good friendly personalities.  Good warm Osaka personalities, definitely not the image of a typical Japanese person in Tokyo.  And more genuinely friendly than any server I’d talked to in the Bay Area (except for a great lady serving at the Ahwahnee restaurant in Yosemite).</p>

<p>Today I finally got to abuse my JR Pass.  And by abuse I mean ride it one only one stop.  I stayed at Shin-Osaka station, so I was able to hop on the Shinkansen into Kyoto (~15 minutes), then take the subway a few stops and walk to Rhinebeck Cafe from there (the cafe is definitely not easily accessible).</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0309-david-calhoun.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Coffee at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" /><figcaption>Coffee at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>It’s a great Kyoto cafe hidden away in an old neighborhood with narrow streets with blind intersections that even persuade normally dauntless taxis to be cautious.</p>

<p>The cafe seems a strange combination: a pancake house inside of an old machiya.</p>

<p>Pancakes?  Machiya?</p>

<p>Pancakes need no explanation, although I should mention they’ve gotten popular inside Japan in the last few years (I’ve also read that the average weight of Japanese people is increasing…).</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0273-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Pancake menu at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" /><figcaption>Pancake menu at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Machiya?  Ok, that needs a bit of explanation.  A machiya is basically an old traditional Japanese house.  Wooden.  Not modern.  With all sorts of special refined Japanese words for all the various parts of the house, I’m certain.</p>

<p>With modern pancakes inside a traditional machiya, in a way this cafe is a perfect representation of Kyoto: a city with one foot in the past and one foot trying to advance into the future.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0278-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Eat Desert First at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" /><figcaption>Eat Desert First at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The space is small but comfortable, with a small traditional garden outside in a courtyard which leads to the bathrooms.  Even after you order you are still taking in the atmosphere.  Then you realize you are breathing some of it: you can distinctly smell the wood ceiling and beams holding it all together.</p>

<p>I’m disappointed because my camera will pick up sights and even sounds, but there’s no way to capture the nice relaxing wood fragrance here.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0280-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Notepad and pen at the table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" /><figcaption>Notepad and pen at the table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>There’s a small notepad with a pen on each table, where customers can doodle and leave messages.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of art students in Kyoto, so the little notepads are inevitably filled with strange creatures recently emerged from their creators’ brain.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0313-david-calhoun.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Drawings on a notepad in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" /><figcaption>Drawings on a notepad in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>And suddenly, a temporary disturbance…</p>

<p>A truck goes by, blasting its message through a loudspeaker into the streets and through the thin walls of the cafe.  It’s election time in Japan.  And you’re forced to hear it for a minute or so until it passes by.  I hope they outlaw those trucks someday.</p>

<p>In any case, this is basically the Japan I love.  The warm and uncrowded cafe.</p>

<p>No matter how beautiful the sakura are outside, I’d rather spend my hours here.</p>

		<p>It’s well into the new year, and I didn’t exactly start the new year off like everyone else, who I imagine all rushed daily into the gym in the first week or two, then apparently gave the habit up soon after.</p>

<p>Sometime in February I found out about a study being conducted at my workplace in conjunction with a university, to track the effects of exercise over the course of a month.  As an extra benefit, I get paid a decent chunk of virtual money into my Google wallet every time I visit a gym in the month of March, during the weekdays.</p>

<p>Now that the study is finally starting, I’m already in the habit of going to the gym and I actually look forward to it.  I actually feel good, and I love the feeling of comign out of the gym and feeling the cool air at night around campus.  For a few minutes I even enjoyed a little stream just outside the gym.</p>

<p>Never thought I’d much like the gym, but I like getting in the habit of going.  It always makes me feel good, and may be a bit of a ward against depression, or at least thoughts I can’t trust.</p>

		<p>In the previous two photo posts I wanted to avoid this sort of heavy reflection New Year post.  But its time has finally come and it should be said, no matter how cheesy it may sound.</p>

<p>I have been living these last few years of my life as driftwood.  At least professionally.  I have all the makings of what should make me happy and successfully in my career, but it’s an illusion.  I am an imposter.  I am living a life as professional driftwood.</p>

<p>What I mean is this: previously I was very active in trying to establish my career as a web developer.  I read as much as I could, practiced as much as I could, and constantly tried to learn new things that would make me better.  </p>

<p>I am living what society calls a good life, but I don’t know myself what a good life really is.  I’m sure it’s not this.</p>

<p>Yuka was still here in early July, just in time to see Fourth of July fireworks at Big Bear Lake, California, before she had to go back to Japan.</p>

<p>Life was getting pretty boring, so I started driving out places alone.  This was a last-minute trip to Mount Shasta Lavender Farm.  Unfortunately because of the extreme drought conditions, the lavenders weren’t as spectacular.  Also, I mistimed it and arrived too late.  They did have a lavender setup outside of the fields, which the bees were busy at work on.</p>

<p>The highlight of August was undoubtedly my first visit to Hawaii with my mom and dad.</p>

<p>Earlier in the month I took a trip off the beaten path at Shoreline Park in Mountain View (where it’s too busy to be peaceful), where I snapped this.  I didn’t see the signs - apparently this was in a restricted area down by the shoreline.</p>

<h2 id="september">September</h2>
<p>I went out on a solo drive to the Eastern Sierras, and happened to time it perfectly to see what little autumn colors there were out near Lake Sabrina.  Previously in 2013, I timed it right to see what was then much more yellow colors, along with a throng of photographers.  This time was much more low key - it was a rainy day, and I only saw a few other people.</p>

<p>It started to rain a little heavily towards the end of my shooting, making it extremely difficult.  The camera started fogging up as well.  Of course when I finally did make it back to the car and started to air out, the rain had to die down.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad came up to visit me in October.  We went up north of San Francisco to hike in Muir Woods.  Afterwards we got some good sushi at Sushi Ran in Sauasalito.</p>

<p>At the very end of the month, I took a one week vacation to visit Yuka in Japan.  Even though she had lived in Osaka all her life, she had never really visited Kyoto and Nara, so we visited both.</p>

<p>When Yuka had to return to work, I spent the rest of my vacation in Japan visiting northern Japan.  I think I just missed the peak of the fall leaves, but I still found some good spots.</p>

<p>We had Christmas at Mom and Dad’s Big Bear cabin.  After Christmas, we took a long day trip up the 395 up to Bishop, California to pick up some bread and beef jerky.  On the way, Mom took an interesting detour to see Fossil Falls, where there was still a bit of evidence of Native Americans.  Mom even found the petroglyph that she’d seen there years before.</p>

<p>Just today, on the last day of 2014, I hiked up to the top of Mission Peak in Fremont, California, with my coworker Jessica, and Kevin and his wife.  It was really cold, and there were really strong, deafaning winds through the alluvial valley floors.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture of cows grazing on the hills on the hike up.  The pond was partially frozen over.  Kevin lifted up a huge rock and thrust it in, creating a hole in the ice and a really strange, completely new sound that I’ve never heard before.  That’s not something that happens everyday.</p>

<p>Here’s to a new year of new sights, sounds, and experiences.  Cheers.</p>

		<p>It’s nearing the year’s end, so of course this means a somewhat sentimental blog post from me.  I was thinking of a “resolutions/goals” type post, but I decided against it.  Instead here’s something more entertaining: my favorite photos from the past year!  Note that these aren’t necessarily my best, just my favorites.</p>

<p>Finding these is also a little bit of housekeeping for me and my photos.  It forces me to sort the gigabytes and gigabytes of RAW photos I was casually dumping onto drives the entire year.</p>

<p>In any case, I did a lot of travelling this year!  I don’t have to think twice to know this is the most I’ve ever travelled in one single year.  Two new US states visited (Louisiana and Florida) and another trip to Japan!</p>

<p>Winter is undoubtedly the least crowded season in Yosemite, and yet it’s an interesting time that folks miss out on.  My Honda Accord isn’t the best car for this, but I got lucky and didn’t need to put on chains.</p>

<p>I drove through the park at night, armed with an upgraded camera.  I’d previously tried to take night images with my Canon 7D, but really struggled.  On the other hand, the versatility of my new Canon 5D Mark III really shined here.  I’m still learning though - I’m sure I could do better somehow.</p>

<p>I went back to Yosemite with Kevin in February, where I was able to tag along and take advantage of his all wheel drive.  If I brought my Accord, I would’ve definitely had to put on noisy chains.</p>

<h2 id="march">March</h2>
<p>Yuka and I traveled all around the area on weekend trips, sometimes going as far as Lone Pine.</p>

<figure class=""><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-edison-lightbulbs-santa-cruz-verde-coffee-5D__1197-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Edison lightbulbs in Verde Coffee in Santa Cruz (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" /><figcaption>Edison lightbulbs in Verde Coffee in Santa Cruz (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>This was a super tough shot to get.  It’s supposed to be the moon in the background at dusk.  No tripod - I think I just balanced the camera on my knee?  Manual focused this one.</p>

<p>This was shot at Manzanar, and obviously we arrived way too late, so we decided to come back the next day.</p>

<figure class=""><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-mount-whitney-night-sky-5D__1777-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Snowy Mount Whitney against the night sky (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" /><figcaption>Snowy Mount Whitney against the night sky (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The almost full moon was out and in a perfect position to illuminate these snowy mountains.  There was an eerie glow coming from them that you could see with your eyes.  We drove as far as we could on Whitney Portal Road before encountering a road block, beyond which the snow wasn’t cleared.  There were a lot of cars parked here, undoubtedly a lot of people kissing in the dark.</p>

<p>Yuka thought I drive her up here so we could kiss too, but I was too interested in my camera and my photography, so I think I upset her a bit.  She was also scared of the eerie mountains.  Definitely a strange feeling from those lit up mountains that night.</p>

<figure class=""><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-manzanar-and-mountains-5D__2141-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Manzanar monument 慰靈塔 (Soul Consoling Tower) (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" /><figcaption>Manzanar monument 慰靈塔 (Soul Consoling Tower) (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>I was amazed at these two cherry trees seemingly in the middle of nowhere, at full bloom.  Certainly something that would’ve attracted much attention if it was in Japan.  But here it was surprisingly uncrowded.</p>

<p>I really doubt I’ll be able to get the timing right on these trees again - I know how time-sensitive they are.  And the high winds in the area must make it tough to get good shots before all the leaves fly away.</p>

<p>The bees were having a field day here!  Never seen so many bees pollinating.</p>

<p>Yuka mentioned visiting the redwoods with a coworker when she was visiting San Jose for work previously.  I was fairly sure it was Big Basin, my favorite place to hike in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>Yuka had a lot of fun, and also discovered tree sap (yes, she instinctually touched it).  Time to get her outdoors more!</p>

<p>New Orleans was a pretty spontaneous trip.  We wanted to fly somewhere, and New Orleans was a place both of us are interested in.</p>

<p>What a great city!  Definitely a party culture which I don’t identify with at all, but more than that: a walkable city with true culture, good food, good music.  And super friendly people.  Strangers who walk past you in the morning and give you an earnest “good morning!” with a smile.  I grew up in LA - my reaction is at first suspicious, but then I realize they’re not asking for money, they’re just being friendly.  What a concept.  What a friendly city!</p>

<p>For better or worse, I became obsessed with brie cheese after eating this, which is a baked wheel of brie cheese with cinammon apples and a clove of garlic on the side, served with crackers and grapes.  I don’t know if it was because I was so hungry from walking so much, but this was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten.  Fantastic!  Now I need to try to recreate this at home sometime.</p>

<p>I last visited Bodie, a real ghosttown, when I was a kid.  I honestly don’t remember much, other than my dad warning me repeatedly to watch where I stepped, and not to step on any nails or any floorboards just lying around.  I also vaguely remember it being hot and dusty.</p>

<p>This trip was made while it was still chilly outside.  The sky was great and perfect.</p>

<p>When I told dad that the last few miles to Bodie is still dirt road, he simply replied “good!”.</p>

<p>I was lucky and really privileged to get invited to speak at JSConf, which I consider the premiere event for JavaScripters.  It’s a fantastically run conference, the best organized I’ve seen, and I was happy and terrified to be invited.  Overall I apparently did alright, but I can’t stand watching my video and think I was entirely too stiff.  I’ve never spoken in front of so many people (it was hundreds in that big main room).</p>

<p>Yuka flew out to see me, and I was so happy to see her again.  We spent time at the Amelia Island resort, but we both kind of decided that resorts weren’t for us.  We decided to explore, so one day we rented a car and drove to St. Augustine, Florida.</p>

<p>Some pieces of history classes came back to me, but to tell you the truth I would never expect there to be Spanish castles and this much Spanish influence left here.  What an interesting place!</p>

<p>Back to local Northern California weekend trips.  Yuka and I enjoyed travelling to Monterey, Morro Bay, Pescadero (garlic/hippy town!), and San Simeon to see Hearst Castle.</p>

<p>We ventured to Sausalito and looked up restaurants on Yelp.  We looked at a few and decided on Sushi Ran.  Expensive but super tasty and nice, and it made Yuka so happy.  We later found out that it’s one of the few Michelin rated restaurants in the area, and was even mentioned by Steve Jobs at the first iPhone keynote as his favorite restaurant in the area.  (note: I REALLY dislike Jobs and his ilk, people who idolize him, but I thought this was an interesting tidbit in any case)</p>

<p>Hearst Castle is another place I visited with my family in childhood, but the memories were still pretty fresh.  Still, it had been over ten years or so.</p>

<p>I remember being fascinated with the ceilings here when I was a kid, so forgive the multiple shots of them.  It’s still hard to capture it all.  The angles here are all so awkward, I’m definitely not used to shooting stuff like this.  This place is probably great for fisheye lenses.</p>

<p>I had always heard of Marshall McCluhan’s famous “the medium is the message”, but really only had a surface level understanding of it until recently, when I first read the essay.</p>

<p>It’s a somewhat eye-opening and challenging piece for various reasons, because it challenges some things I thought I had a good grasp of.  Particularly the repeated shooting-down in the essay of people who claim it’s how the medium is used that matters, not the medium itself.  McCluhan disagrees with this by constantly impressing upon the reader not only that the medium and content are inseparable and come as a whole package, but that there is really no distinction to be made between content and medium.  It’s one medium nicely packaged in another medium.  This is the meaning of “the medium is the message”.</p>

<p>And could we go on?  That one medium could be packaged in another, which is itself packaged in yet another medium?  This certainly doesn’t seem unreasonable, as at one point in the essay it’s argued that speech is a medium for writing, which is yet another medium: the medium for inner thoughts.  Record someone on television giving a speech and you add yet another level.  It’s really mediums all the way down.</p>

<p>The original essay was written on the cusp of the digital information age, and had a concern with the medium of writing getting surpassed by print, which in turn seemed to be getting surpassed by television, radio, and digital information.  Though at times it might seem luddite, anti-television or anti-new-mediums, especially towards the end of the essay, I don’t see that as the intent of the article.  The end of the article was just trying to hit home a point that these mediums have become human appendages, consciously and subconsciously, and they are inescapable.  For better or worse.  The point is that if the mediums are only subconscious, then they influence us and trap us in invisible prisons.  By making us conscious of mediums we can study them and at least try to understand them better than we could at the subconscious level.</p>

<p>More than fifty years after the article was written, we are well into the digital information age, and we are starting to see the Internet surpass television.  The timelessness of The Medium is The Message is that these same insights can be used to understand the pervasiveness of the Internet medium all around us today.  Another important message here was that these mediums pervade and influence culture - just as the printing press played a crucial role in the French Revolution.  And often times we don’t realize these mediums as playing such a pervasive role until after the fact.</p>

<p>Smart phones have just recently invaded our society in our public and personal lives.  Our societies have already been substantially changed and molded by this new medium, and yet only now do we start asking ourselves questions like “is it bad to use my phone too much?”, “is it bad manners to use a phone at the dinner table?”, “is it ok to give a phone to a kid?”.</p>

<p>I’d made assumptions before that the blog posts I write on my website are content-first, so I’ve made an effort to remove any designs or parts of this medium that is distracting to that content.  Hence the super minimalist design I have in place currently.  But I never considered that there are parts of this presentation medium that can’t be sidestepped and avoided.</p>

<p>I had thought that maybe some of my blog posts could be printed and still retain the same message.  However, according to McCluhan this would be impossible, since the medium is married to the message (not to mention that the message is actually just another medium).  On this view the reader’s experience of reading my blog post on their laptop or desktop is an entirely different experience from reading on their phone, in an altogether different environment and in different circumstances (e.g. at home versus riding the train).</p>

<p>It seems that we can take this even further, to its natural extent.  It seems that every city has a different overall culture and a different feel.  In that sense a city and its people can be assumed to be a sort of very large medium.  A person reading a news article in one city could be reading the same article as a person in a different city.  It seems not unreasonable that their experiences could be very different because their very environment - their city - permeates their experiences.  A city itself as a medium can then help ideas flourish (in a zeitgeist sort of way) or can even stifle ideas.</p>

<p>A city can very well itself be a medium.</p>

		<p>A while back I had a need for a general timeout option for async.parallel and was surprised I couldn’t find much information about how to do it.  I was using async.parallel to make a lot of REST calls in parallel, but one of them was getting blocked by a firewall, resulting in an eventual timeout minutes later.</p>

<p>One option was to specify a shorter timeout for each individual REST call, including the one causing the problem.  But I wanted a simpler solution: a general timeout for that specific async.parallel instance that made it clear all tasks should finish within a certain period of time. Otherwise return a timeout as an error, allowing the program to continue (and retry if necessary).</p>

<p>It was somewhat surprising there wasn’t an option built into async.parallel, as I could imagine other folks must have had the same problem at some point in time.</p>

<p>In any case, I wrote a pretty simple wrapper function that gets the job done (see example usage below):</p>
