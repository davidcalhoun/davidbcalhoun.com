		<p>I was just putting together this article and these photos on New Year’s Eve when I glanced and the clock and noticed I was already four minutes into 2015.  Oops!</p>

<p>Here’s the second-parter for my favorite photo from 2014.  Also be sure to check out the <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-2014/">first part</a>.</p>

<h2 id="july">July</h2>

<p>Yuka was still here in early July, just in time to see Fourth of July fireworks at Big Bear Lake, California, before she had to go back to Japan.</p>

<p>Life was getting pretty boring, so I started driving out places alone.  This was a last-minute trip to Mount Shasta Lavender Farm.  Unfortunately because of the extreme drought conditions, the lavenders weren’t as spectacular.  Also, I mistimed it and arrived too late.  They did have a lavender setup outside of the fields, which the bees were busy at work on.</p>

<h2 id="august">August</h2>
<p>The highlight of August was undoubtedly my first visit to Hawaii with my mom and dad.</p>

<p>Earlier in the month I took a trip off the beaten path at Shoreline Park in Mountain View (where it’s too busy to be peaceful), where I snapped this.  I didn’t see the signs - apparently this was in a restricted area down by the shoreline.</p>

<p>Hawaii!  Mom and Dad were kind enough to show me around all the places they’ve enjoyed visiting.</p>

<h2 id="september">September</h2>
<p>I went out on a solo drive to the Eastern Sierras, and happened to time it perfectly to see what little autumn colors there were out near Lake Sabrina.  Previously in 2013, I timed it right to see what was then much more yellow colors, along with a throng of photographers.  This time was much more low key - it was a rainy day, and I only saw a few other people.</p>

<p>It started to rain a little heavily towards the end of my shooting, making it extremely difficult.  The camera started fogging up as well.  Of course when I finally did make it back to the car and started to air out, the rain had to die down.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad came up to visit me in October.  We went up north of San Francisco to hike in Muir Woods.  Afterwards we got some good sushi at Sushi Ran in Sauasalito.</p>

<p>At the very end of the month, I took a one week vacation to visit Yuka in Japan.  Even though she had lived in Osaka all her life, she had never really visited Kyoto and Nara, so we visited both.</p>

<p>When Yuka had to return to work, I spent the rest of my vacation in Japan visiting northern Japan.  I think I just missed the peak of the fall leaves, but I still found some good spots.</p>

<h2 id="december">December</h2>
<p>We had Christmas at Mom and Dad’s Big Bear cabin.  After Christmas, we took a long day trip up the 395 up to Bishop, California to pick up some bread and beef jerky.  On the way, Mom took an interesting detour to see Fossil Falls, where there was still a bit of evidence of Native Americans.  Mom even found the petroglyph that she’d seen there years before.</p>

<p>Just today, on the last day of 2014, I hiked up to the top of Mission Peak in Fremont, California, with my coworker Jessica, and Kevin and his wife.  It was really cold, and there were really strong, deafaning winds through the alluvial valley floors.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture of cows grazing on the hills on the hike up.  The pond was partially frozen over.  Kevin lifted up a huge rock and thrust it in, creating a hole in the ice and a really strange, completely new sound that I’ve never heard before.  That’s not something that happens everyday.</p>

<p>Here’s to a new year of new sights, sounds, and experiences.  Cheers.</p>

		<p>It’s nearing the year’s end, so of course this means a somewhat sentimental blog post from me.  I was thinking of a “resolutions/goals” type post, but I decided against it.  Instead here’s something more entertaining: my favorite photos from the past year!  Note that these aren’t necessarily my best, just my favorites.</p>

<p>Finding these is also a little bit of housekeeping for me and my photos.  It forces me to sort the gigabytes and gigabytes of RAW photos I was casually dumping onto drives the entire year.</p>

<p>In any case, I did a lot of travelling this year!  I don’t have to think twice to know this is the most I’ve ever travelled in one single year.  Two new US states visited (Louisiana and Florida) and another trip to Japan!</p>

<h2 id="january">January</h2>

<p>Winter is undoubtedly the least crowded season in Yosemite, and yet it’s an interesting time that folks miss out on.  My Honda Accord isn’t the best car for this, but I got lucky and didn’t need to put on chains.</p>

<p>I drove through the park at night, armed with an upgraded camera.  I’d previously tried to take night images with my Canon 7D, but really struggled.  On the other hand, the versatility of my new Canon 5D Mark III really shined here.  I’m still learning though - I’m sure I could do better somehow.</p>

<p>Later that month I had my inevitable 30th birthday, and much love shown to me by my friends and family.</p>

<h2 id="february">February</h2>

<p>I went back to Yosemite with Kevin in February, where I was able to tag along and take advantage of his all wheel drive.  If I brought my Accord, I would’ve definitely had to put on noisy chains.</p>

<p>Yuka and I traveled all around the area on weekend trips, sometimes going as far as Lone Pine.</p>

<p>This was a super tough shot to get.  It’s supposed to be the moon in the background at dusk.  No tripod - I think I just balanced the camera on my knee?  Manual focused this one.</p>

<p>This was shot at Manzanar, and obviously we arrived way too late, so we decided to come back the next day.</p>

<figure class=""><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-mount-whitney-night-sky-5D__1777-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Snowy Mount Whitney against the night sky (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" /><figcaption>Snowy Mount Whitney against the night sky (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The almost full moon was out and in a perfect position to illuminate these snowy mountains.  There was an eerie glow coming from them that you could see with your eyes.  We drove as far as we could on Whitney Portal Road before encountering a road block, beyond which the snow wasn’t cleared.  There were a lot of cars parked here, undoubtedly a lot of people kissing in the dark.</p>

<p>Yuka thought I drive her up here so we could kiss too, but I was too interested in my camera and my photography, so I think I upset her a bit.  She was also scared of the eerie mountains.  Definitely a strange feeling from those lit up mountains that night.</p>

<p>I was amazed at these two cherry trees seemingly in the middle of nowhere, at full bloom.  Certainly something that would’ve attracted much attention if it was in Japan.  But here it was surprisingly uncrowded.</p>

<p>I really doubt I’ll be able to get the timing right on these trees again - I know how time-sensitive they are.  And the high winds in the area must make it tough to get good shots before all the leaves fly away.</p>

<p>The bees were having a field day here!  Never seen so many bees pollinating.</p>

<p>Yuka mentioned visiting the redwoods with a coworker when she was visiting San Jose for work previously.  I was fairly sure it was Big Basin, my favorite place to hike in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>Yuka had a lot of fun, and also discovered tree sap (yes, she instinctually touched it).  Time to get her outdoors more!</p>

<p>New Orleans was a pretty spontaneous trip.  We wanted to fly somewhere, and New Orleans was a place both of us are interested in.</p>

<p>What a great city!  Definitely a party culture which I don’t identify with at all, but more than that: a walkable city with true culture, good food, good music.  And super friendly people.  Strangers who walk past you in the morning and give you an earnest “good morning!” with a smile.  I grew up in LA - my reaction is at first suspicious, but then I realize they’re not asking for money, they’re just being friendly.  What a concept.  What a friendly city!</p>

<p>For better or worse, I became obsessed with brie cheese after eating this, which is a baked wheel of brie cheese with cinammon apples and a clove of garlic on the side, served with crackers and grapes.  I don’t know if it was because I was so hungry from walking so much, but this was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten.  Fantastic!  Now I need to try to recreate this at home sometime.</p>

<p>I last visited Bodie, a real ghosttown, when I was a kid.  I honestly don’t remember much, other than my dad warning me repeatedly to watch where I stepped, and not to step on any nails or any floorboards just lying around.  I also vaguely remember it being hot and dusty.</p>

<p>This trip was made while it was still chilly outside.  The sky was great and perfect.</p>

<p>When I told dad that the last few miles to Bodie is still dirt road, he simply replied “good!”.</p>

<p>I was lucky and really privileged to get invited to speak at JSConf, which I consider the premiere event for JavaScripters.  It’s a fantastically run conference, the best organized I’ve seen, and I was happy and terrified to be invited.  Overall I apparently did alright, but I can’t stand watching my video and think I was entirely too stiff.  I’ve never spoken in front of so many people (it was hundreds in that big main room).</p>

<p>Yuka flew out to see me, and I was so happy to see her again.  We spent time at the Amelia Island resort, but we both kind of decided that resorts weren’t for us.  We decided to explore, so one day we rented a car and drove to St. Augustine, Florida.</p>

<p>Some pieces of history classes came back to me, but to tell you the truth I would never expect there to be Spanish castles and this much Spanish influence left here.  What an interesting place!</p>

<p>Back to local Northern California weekend trips.  Yuka and I enjoyed travelling to Monterey, Morro Bay, Pescadero (garlic/hippy town!), and San Simeon to see Hearst Castle.</p>

<p>We ventured to Sausalito and looked up restaurants on Yelp.  We looked at a few and decided on Sushi Ran.  Expensive but super tasty and nice, and it made Yuka so happy.  We later found out that it’s one of the few Michelin rated restaurants in the area, and was even mentioned by Steve Jobs at the first iPhone keynote as his favorite restaurant in the area.  (note: I REALLY dislike Jobs and his ilk, people who idolize him, but I thought this was an interesting tidbit in any case)</p>

<p>Hearst Castle is another place I visited with my family in childhood, but the memories were still pretty fresh.  Still, it had been over ten years or so.</p>

<p>I remember being fascinated with the ceilings here when I was a kid, so forgive the multiple shots of them.  It’s still hard to capture it all.  The angles here are all so awkward, I’m definitely not used to shooting stuff like this.  This place is probably great for fisheye lenses.</p>

<p>I had always heard of Marshall McCluhan’s famous “the medium is the message”, but really only had a surface level understanding of it until recently, when I first read the essay.</p>

<p>It’s a somewhat eye-opening and challenging piece for various reasons, because it challenges some things I thought I had a good grasp of.  Particularly the repeated shooting-down in the essay of people who claim it’s how the medium is used that matters, not the medium itself.  McCluhan disagrees with this by constantly impressing upon the reader not only that the medium and content are inseparable and come as a whole package, but that there is really no distinction to be made between content and medium.  It’s one medium nicely packaged in another medium.  This is the meaning of “the medium is the message”.</p>

<p>And could we go on?  That one medium could be packaged in another, which is itself packaged in yet another medium?  This certainly doesn’t seem unreasonable, as at one point in the essay it’s argued that speech is a medium for writing, which is yet another medium: the medium for inner thoughts.  Record someone on television giving a speech and you add yet another level.  It’s really mediums all the way down.</p>

<p>The original essay was written on the cusp of the digital information age, and had a concern with the medium of writing getting surpassed by print, which in turn seemed to be getting surpassed by television, radio, and digital information.  Though at times it might seem luddite, anti-television or anti-new-mediums, especially towards the end of the essay, I don’t see that as the intent of the article.  The end of the article was just trying to hit home a point that these mediums have become human appendages, consciously and subconsciously, and they are inescapable.  For better or worse.  The point is that if the mediums are only subconscious, then they influence us and trap us in invisible prisons.  By making us conscious of mediums we can study them and at least try to understand them better than we could at the subconscious level.</p>

<p>More than fifty years after the article was written, we are well into the digital information age, and we are starting to see the Internet surpass television.  The timelessness of The Medium is The Message is that these same insights can be used to understand the pervasiveness of the Internet medium all around us today.  Another important message here was that these mediums pervade and influence culture - just as the printing press played a crucial role in the French Revolution.  And often times we don’t realize these mediums as playing such a pervasive role until after the fact.</p>

<p>Smart phones have just recently invaded our society in our public and personal lives.  Our societies have already been substantially changed and molded by this new medium, and yet only now do we start asking ourselves questions like “is it bad to use my phone too much?”, “is it bad manners to use a phone at the dinner table?”, “is it ok to give a phone to a kid?”.</p>

<p>I’d made assumptions before that the blog posts I write on my website are content-first, so I’ve made an effort to remove any designs or parts of this medium that is distracting to that content.  Hence the super minimalist design I have in place currently.  But I never considered that there are parts of this presentation medium that can’t be sidestepped and avoided.</p>

<p>I had thought that maybe some of my blog posts could be printed and still retain the same message.  However, according to McCluhan this would be impossible, since the medium is married to the message (not to mention that the message is actually just another medium).  On this view the reader’s experience of reading my blog post on their laptop or desktop is an entirely different experience from reading on their phone, in an altogether different environment and in different circumstances (e.g. at home versus riding the train).</p>

<figure class="left half"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/kyoto-downtown.jpg" width="1000" height="673" title="Kyoto's downtown (Photo by David Calhoun, 2011)" /><figcaption>Kyoto&#8217;s downtown (Photo by David Calhoun, 2011)</figcaption></figure>

<p>It seems that we can take this even further, to its natural extent.  It seems that every city has a different overall culture and a different feel.  In that sense a city and its people can be assumed to be a sort of very large medium.  A person reading a news article in one city could be reading the same article as a person in a different city.  It seems not unreasonable that their experiences could be very different because their very environment - their city - permeates their experiences.  A city itself as a medium can then help ideas flourish (in a zeitgeist sort of way) or can even stifle ideas.</p>

<p>A city can very well itself be a medium.</p>

		<p>A while back I had a need for a general timeout option for async.parallel and was surprised I couldn’t find much information about how to do it.  I was using async.parallel to make a lot of REST calls in parallel, but one of them was getting blocked by a firewall, resulting in an eventual timeout minutes later.</p>

<p>One option was to specify a shorter timeout for each individual REST call, including the one causing the problem.  But I wanted a simpler solution: a general timeout for that specific async.parallel instance that made it clear all tasks should finish within a certain period of time. Otherwise return a timeout as an error, allowing the program to continue (and retry if necessary).</p>

<p>It was somewhat surprising there wasn’t an option built into async.parallel, as I could imagine other folks must have had the same problem at some point in time.</p>

<p>In any case, I wrote a pretty simple wrapper function that gets the job done (see example usage below):</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to finally visit Hawaii with my parents.  Being experts Hawaii tourists, they set us up in a nice traditional resort called The Mauian - a nice quiet(er) little place that has a time for “quiet hours” (apparently the other resorts are places to party).</p>

<p>We got back to the hotel a little after quiet hours, and my folks mentioned that you could see the Milky Way quite clearly.  Being Hawaii, and Maui at that, there wasn’t a lot of light pollution like we’re used to.  I thought I better not miss the chance, and went and grabbed my 16-35mm f/2.8.</p>

<p>I didn’t bring any sort of a tripod on this trip, so I grabbed my spare pants and rolled them up a bit, then rested the camera on them.  Not too bad, actually.</p>

<p>The final settings: 16mm f/2.8, 4 seconds @ ISO 6400.  I was also sure to move to manual focus and set the focus at the sweet-spot (live view helps a bit here).</p>

<p>There was surprisingly little post-processing.  I added the usual tweaks to highlights and shadows and adjusted the black and white levels very slightly.  Added a bit of clarity and a bit of vibrance to bring out the colors.  This was at ISO 6400, so I added some noise reduction combined with some sharpening.</p>

<p>Recently I have been lusting after a nicer astrophotography lens, the 24mm f/1.4, but this photo I took with my existing gear mostly proved to me that I can make do with what I have.  Also, location matters the most.  You can’t get these kinds of shots from where I live without driving hundreds and hundreds of miles away.</p>

				What Is AMD, CommonJS, and UMD?</a>

	</header>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Over the years there’s been a steadily increasing ecosystem of JavaScript components to choose from.  The sheer amount of choices is fantastic, but this also infamously presents a difficulty when components are mixed-and-matched.  And it doesn’t take too long for budding developers to find out that not all components are built to play nicely together.</p>

<p>To address these issues, the competing module specs AMD and CommonJS have appeared on the scene, allowing developers to write their code in an agreed-upon sandboxed and modularized way, so as not to “pollute the ecosystem”.</p>

<h3 id="amd">AMD</h3>
<p>Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) has gained traction on the frontend, with RequireJS being the most popular implementation.</p>

<p>Here’s module <code>foo</code> with a single dependency on <code>jquery</code>:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
<a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a>
<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">//    filename: foo.js</span>
define([<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">jquery</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>], <span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="predefined">$</span>) {
    <span class="comment">//    methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">myFunc</span>(){};

    <span class="comment">//    exposed public methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> myFunc;
});
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>And a little more complicated example with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
<a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a>
<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
<a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a>
<strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong>
<a href="#n11" name="n11">11</a>
<a href="#n12" name="n12">12</a>
<a href="#n13" name="n13">13</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">//    filename: foo.js</span>
define([<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">jquery</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">underscore</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>], <span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="predefined">$</span>, _) {
    <span class="comment">//    methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">a</span>(){};    <span class="comment">//    private because it's not returned (see below)</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">b</span>(){};    <span class="comment">//    public because it's returned</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">c</span>(){};    <span class="comment">//    public because it's returned</span>

    <span class="comment">//    exposed public methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> {
        <span class="key">b</span>: b,
        <span class="key">c</span>: c
    }
});
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>The first part of the define is an array of dependencies, while the second part is essentially the callback function which is only executed when the dependencies are available (script loaders like RequireJS take care of that part, including figuring out where the files are located).</p>

<p>Note that the dependency to variable order is important (ex. jquery-&gt;<code>$</code>, underscore-&gt;<code>_</code>).</p>

<p>Also note that we can map the dependencies to any arbitrary variables we want here.  If we change <code>$</code> to <code>$$</code> in the code above, all jQuery references within our function block will be <code>$$</code> instead of <code>$</code>.</p>

<p>And note, most importantly, that you can’t reference the variables <code>$</code> and <code>_</code> outside of the function, because it’s sandboxed from other code.  That’s the goal here!</p>

<h3 id="commonjs">CommonJS</h3>

<p>CommonJS is a style you may be familiar with if you’re written anything in Node (which uses a slight variant).  It’s also been gaining traction on the frontend with Browserify.</p>

<p>Using the same format as before, here’s what our <code>foo</code> module looks like in CommonJS:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>

<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
<a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a>
<strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">//    filename: foo.js</span>

<span class="comment">//    dependencies</span>

<span class="comment">//    methods</span>
<span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">myFunc</span>(){};

<span class="comment">//    exposed public method (single)</span>
module.exports = myFunc;
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>And our more complicate example, with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>

module.exports = {

    <span class="key">c</span>: c
};
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<h3 id="umd-universal-module-definition">UMD: Universal Module Definition</h3>

<p>Since CommonJS and AMD styles have both been equally popular, it seems there’s yet no consensus.  This has brought about the push for a “universal” pattern that supports both styles, which brings us to none other than the Universal Module Definition.</p>

<p>The pattern is admittedly ugly, but is both AMD and CommonJS compatible, as well as supporting the old-style “global” variable definition:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>

</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">function</span> (root, factory) {
    <span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="keyword">typeof</span> define === <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">function</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> &amp;&amp; define.amd) {

<p>What you tried to read above was not entirely different from my once-a-year curiosity visit to Yahoo’s mobile homepage (ok, minus the jab at the much-hated Tapatalk).  During the course of one visit and one search, those really are all the prompts which got in the way of what I was trying to accomplish on the site.</p>

<p>While I’d love to pick on Yahoo in particular, mobile users know this common experience all too well.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that the primary content of many mobile sites is now a big giant “Download the app here” button.  How strange that we find ourseles in a world where the secondary content is that which the user is actually interested in.</p>

<h3 id="native-vs-web">Native vs. Web</h3>
<p>Like most things, we humans like to create dichotomies, and we did the same with native and web, persistently thinking them to be mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>For a short time, it seemed, contrary to mobile platforms that came before, that the revolutionary smartphone of 2007 would have developers creating a flurry of web apps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps <em>that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone</em>. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services. They can make a call, they can send an email, they can look up a location on Google Maps. And guess what? There’s no SDK that you need! You’ve got everything you need if you know how to write apps using the most modern web standards to write amazing apps for the iPhone today. So developers, we think we’ve got a very sweet story for you. You can begin building your iPhone apps today. (<a href="http://youtu.be/8Vq993Td6ys?t=37s">Steve Jobs at WWDC 2007</a>, emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, even in that keynote you can see shades of web apps being pitted against native apps.  And what would both developers and consumers rather have: an emulated native experience, or a true native experience?  Most folks have always wanted the latter, and the latter has consistently delivered a better user experience.</p>

<p>Very talented developers have created “native-like” experiences on the web, including the old iPhone user guide (powered by <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2009/pastrykit-digging-into-an-apple-pie/">PastryKit</a>), but all along it’s been native apps which have required less effort and less clever tricks for smooth user interfaces.  However, this being said, it should also be noted that many native apps today actually have a web view component, and end users are often unaware of this fact.</p>

<p>In 2007, after the release of the first iPhone, the web app vision was soon abandoned after a somewhat lackluster and uncoordinated response from us developers.  Apple also realized the monetary potential of native apps and a wildly successful centralized App Store, a path that’s led us to our current situation:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/109749/Apps-Solidify-Leadership-Six-Years-into-the-Mobile-Revolution"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/apps-dominate.jpg" alt="Apps Continue to Dominate the Mobile Web: 2013 saw 80% of time spent in apps and 20% of time on the mobile web, whereas 2014 is currently seeing 86% app usage and 14% mobile web usage." /></a></p>

<h3 id="keep-calm-and-carry-on-">Keep Calm and Carry On… ?</h3>
<p>The web isn’t going away anytime soon, and that means the mobile web is also here to stay, even if less people are using it.  But it unfortunately means less emphasis on mobile experiences, which means less demand for mobile web developers.</p>

<p>It means that the mobile web, and probably the larger web as a whole, will only be considered as an afterthought, if considered at all.  We’ve already witnessed this happening with the mobile web being considered a sort of sub/side topic of responsive web design.</p>

<p>Just for fun, I wanted to reproduce a cool but completely superfluous UI I saw in the updated Foursquare app recently. Basically, when the user tries to scroll past the upper bound of the app/page, the header image becomes blurred.</p>

<p>We can do the same thing on the web by listening for negative scroll and then using (abusing?) CSS filters.</p>

<p>Note that there’s an extra trick for iOS, which presents problems I had forgotten about (namely, no negative scroll, and a scroll listener which fires once at the end of scrolling). That’s why I had to throw in some extra logic for touchstart/touchmove/touchend.</p>

<h4 id="explanation-1">Explanation</h4>

<p>Again, no sanitization needed here because i is guaranteed to be an integer. The solution relies on an understanding of the modulus function - this is something usually learned in school, but something I haven’t had to use since, except in interviews or quizzes. Or quizzes during interviews.</p>

<p>Basically, think of modulus as “remainder” function for division problems. For instance, <code>4 % 2</code> will give a modulus of <code>1</code> because 4 goes into 2 twice, evenly, with zero remainder. On the other hand, <code>5 % 2</code> will give a modulus of <code>1</code> because 5 goes into 2 twice, with a remainder of 1. This turns out to be a handy way to differentiate even (4) and odd (5) numbers.</p>

<p>(note that the <code>else</code> isn’t needed here, but it gives greater clarity to what’s going on)</p>

</div>

<h4 id="explanation-2">Explanation</h4>

<p>Now we’re getting a bit tougher!</p>

<p>Strings have a handy function that splits them into an array: <code>split()</code>. For instance,</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">foo.bar.baz</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>.split(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">.</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>)
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>will output</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>[<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">foo</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">bar</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">baz</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>]
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Notice that the periods have been removed, just as the prompt asked for!</p>

<p>In this case we need to first check if there was no file extension. This means that there were no periods to split on, resulting in a one-member array (<code>"foo".split(".")</code> becomes <code>["foo"]</code>). In this case we return <code>false</code>, as the prompt asks for.</p>

<p>Now, in the else case, we know that the array must be larger than 1, meaning that it has a file extension. Since the file extension is always at the end, we know that it must be the last member in the array.</p>

<p>We can find the index of the last member by taking into account array length (<code>filenameArray.length</code>) and the fact that the array is zero-indexed, meaning that we need to subtract 1 from this length. Now we know the extension exists and is at the end of the array, so all we need to do is return it:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>

  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">return</span> filenameArray[filenameArray.length - <span class="integer">1</span>];

<h4 id="explanation-3">Explanation</h4>

<p>This is a pretty classic interview question. It’s fairly easy and straightforward: just keep track of the longest string in a variable, then loop through all the members of the array. If the current member is longer, set it as the new longest string. At the end, return whatever that variable contains.</p>

<p>Note the extra sanitization check here to make sure the type is a string. If it’s not a string, we <code>continue</code> to continue to the next iteration of the <code>for</code> loop. (Note that this is similar to returning early in functions)</p>

<h4 id="explanation-4">Explanation</h4>

<p>The best way to handle this one is through recursion, which is tricky but powerful. I admit that on my first attempts writing it in the console, my browser froze up and I had to restart it.</p>

<p>Recursive functions are very elegant but tricky. It helps to step through with examples.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with <code>arraySum(1)</code>. The output is of course 1, but note that we didn’t actually input an array. The code took the first codepath in the <code>if</code> statement (because <code>typeof 1 === "number"</code> is true)</p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we input a basic array:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>arraySum([<span class="integer">1</span>]);  <span class="comment">// 1</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Again the answer is 1, but this time the codepath was different. This time <code>Array.isArray([1])</code> was true, and the function was called recursively for each of the members in the array. That is to say, each member of the array (in this case the single member) was sent to arraySum as a simple integer. So the recursive call was the same as the original example: <code>arraySum(1)</code>, and the output was the same.</p>

<p>In the case of more numbers, the outputs are all added to the <code>sum</code> and then returned back at the end of the function.</p>

<p>Note that this works quite well for even deeply nested arrays, since arraySum() has logic for arrays that will always return the sum of all of its deeply nested integers:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>arraySum([<span class="integer">1</span>, [<span class="integer">2</span>,[<span class="integer">3</span>,[<span class="integer">4</span>,[<span class="integer">5</span>]]]]]);   <span class="comment">// 15</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

		<p>When I came back from Japan and accepted an offer to work at a startup in Silicon Valley, I knew one of the biggest challenges would be to find a decent and affordable apartment in Mountain View, close to where I’d be working. I had it all planned out, and how healthy and convenient it would be to walk to work and also Mountain View downtown!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this dream was shared by me and hundreds of thousands of other like-minded software engineers. Which isn’t unexpected, really. If you spend enough time in Silicon Valley, everyone’s ideas start to sound the same after a while.</p>

<p>Mountain View, if you didn’t already know, is home to the now omnipresent non-evil company known as Google. Google has been fast taking over Mountain View, building by building, campus extension by campus extension. They even have their name on the sidewalks near where I take walks at work. Because they own those, too. (Actually, they own the fiber connections running beneath them).</p>

<p>One day I went out apartment hunting and was pretty happy the apartment listed earlier in the day hadn’t already sold, as had happened several times earlier (yes, there is THAT much competition).</p>

<p>As I drove up and approached the apartment, I noticed the unwelcoming stare of a single woman waiting outside the complex. She didn’t say anything, so I mentioned that she must be waiting for the apartment walk-through the same as myself. She acknowledged and then mentioned that “he was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago”, referring to the current tenant who was supposed to show up earlier for an apartment viewing.</p>

<p>I saw that she was pretty serious about maintaining that she was here first, and I cracked a joke about folks being cutthroat because of the competition or some such thing, to try to break the tension. I even said it with a smile, which is supposed to prompt at least a crack of a smile in any human capable of empathy. Sadly it had no effect on this poor emotionless woman. It was clear that she was all business.</p>

<p>It’s not dissimilar to the animal kingdom, really. She was just establishing her dominance by passively explaining that she was here before I was. Oh I see, so even if I wanted this place, I’d have no shot at it, because you were here first? I guess that’s what you have to do these days to ensure you get a place…</p>

<p>I hear it’s worse in “The City®” (San Francisco), and I’m not surprised really. The last time I was looking for apartments there, it was a crappy little studio apartment in a crappy part of town, with what looked like 20 people lined up ahead of me to put down a deposit. No thank you. Sometimes I think I’d rather live someplace in the country.</p>

<p>Alright, back to my apartment hunting story in Mountain View. I figured I might as well take a look at the place, since I’d taken the time to come by. Some other folks showed up and started waiting in the same spot, until finally the current tenant came by, apologized for the wait, and took us through the apartment.</p>

<p>To be honest, the apartment was nothing special. It was an older apartment that was part of a fourplex with families with kids on all sides. Not exactly a quiet place. Sure, there was nice lush greenery everywhere, and of course it was conveniently situated in Mountain View, but it was overall not exceptional. But in a bubble economy, the location is now sufficient to make anything special and worth the price.</p>

<p>I asked the current tenant about cable internet availability, and the single woman decided to use her God-given right to interrupt and respond: “The entire city of Mountain View has WiFi provided for free by Google”. Without missing a beat, she added some other talking points as if they were coming out of a pre-prepared handbook. It actually kind of sounded like someone reciting a memorized passage from the Bible. And there was a certain pride behind it, to give me a hint that I need not ask if she worked for the blasted company.</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to say other than, “Oh, that’s cool”. I really wasn’t prepared to deal with corporate shills on what had become an epic search for an apartment.</p>

<p>After looking around a bit more, I was the second to last person to talk to the owner and take an application. He was more than patient with me, but I noticed the very last person waiting in the shadows to talk to him was The Google Bitch. Dammit, so she had some scheme she was waiting to thrust on the poor guy.</p>

<p>As I walked away and went back to my car, still within earshot The Google Bitch made an offer to the guy: “So, I am prepared to put down money today to secure this apartment” she said confidently. The current tenant just said “Wow, ok” and they talked from there.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I never turned in the application, as it would’ve just been a waste of everyone’s time.</p>

<p>I have since settled into an apartment community in Sunnyvale, where I have been adopted by a very extended, loving Indian family. They sometimes give me funny looks when I walk through the complex, but it’s all good. Perhaps the farther from The Google Bitch and people like her, the better.</p>
