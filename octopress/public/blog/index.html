<p>I was lucky enough to finally visit Hawaii with my parents.  Being experts Hawaii tourists, they set us up in a nice traditional resort called The Mauian - a nice quiet(er) little place that has a time for “quiet hours” (apparently the other resorts are places to party).</p>

<p>We got back to the hotel a little after quiet hours, and my folks mentioned that you could see the Milky Way quite clearly.  Being Hawaii, and Maui at that, there wasn’t a lot of light pollution like we’re used to.  I thought I better not miss the chance, and went and grabbed my 16-35mm f/2.8.</p>

<p>I didn’t bring any sort of a tripod on this trip, so I grabbed my spare pants and rolled them up a bit, then rested the camera on them.  Not too bad, actually.</p>

<p>The final settings: 16mm f/2.8, 4 seconds @ ISO 6400.  I was also sure to move to manual focus and set the focus at the sweet-spot (live view helps a bit here).</p>

<p>There was surprisingly little post-processing.  I added the usual tweaks to highlights and shadows and adjusted the black and white levels very slightly.  Added a bit of clarity and a bit of vibrance to bring out the colors.  This was at ISO 6400, so I added some noise reduction combined with some sharpening.</p>

<p>Recently I have been lusting after a nicer astrophotography lens, the 24mm f/1.4, but this photo I took with my existing gear mostly proved to me that I can make do with what I have.  Also, location matters the most.  You can’t get these kinds of shots from where I live without driving hundreds and hundreds of miles away.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Over the years there’s been a steadily increasing ecosystem of JavaScript components to choose from.  The sheer amount of choices is fantastic, but this also infamously presents a difficulty when components are mixed-and-matched.  And it doesn’t take too long for budding developers to find out that not all components are built to play nicely together.</p>

<p>To address these issues, the competing module specs AMD and CommonJS have appeared on the scene, allowing developers to write their code in an agreed-upon sandboxed and modularized way, so as not to “pollute the ecosystem”.</p>

<h3 id="amd">AMD</h3>
<p>Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) has gained traction on the frontend, with RequireJS being the most popular implementation.</p>

<p>Here’s module <code>foo</code> with a single dependency on <code>jquery</code>:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
<a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a>
<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">//    filename: foo.js</span>
define([<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">jquery</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>], <span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="predefined">$</span>) {
    <span class="comment">//    methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">myFunc</span>(){};

    <span class="comment">//    exposed public methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> myFunc;
});
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>And a little more complicated example with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
<a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a>
<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
<a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a>
<strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong>
<a href="#n11" name="n11">11</a>
<a href="#n12" name="n12">12</a>
<a href="#n13" name="n13">13</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">//    filename: foo.js</span>
define([<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">jquery</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">underscore</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>], <span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="predefined">$</span>, _) {
    <span class="comment">//    methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">a</span>(){};    <span class="comment">//    private because it's not returned (see below)</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">b</span>(){};    <span class="comment">//    public because it's returned</span>
    <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">c</span>(){};    <span class="comment">//    public because it's returned</span>

    <span class="comment">//    exposed public methods</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> {
        <span class="key">b</span>: b,
        <span class="key">c</span>: c
    }
});
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>The first part of the define is an array of dependencies, while the second part is essentially the callback function which is only executed when the dependencies are available (script loaders like RequireJS take care of that part, including figuring out where the files are located).</p>

<p>Note that the dependency to variable order is important (ex. jquery-&gt;<code>$</code>, underscore-&gt;<code>_</code>).</p>

<p>Also note that we can map the dependencies to any arbitrary variables we want here.  If we change <code>$</code> to <code>$$</code> in the code above, all jQuery references within our function block will be <code>$$</code> instead of <code>$</code>.</p>

<p>And note, most importantly, that you can’t reference the variables <code>$</code> and <code>_</code> outside of the function, because it’s sandboxed from other code.  That’s the goal here!</p>

<h3 id="commonjs">CommonJS</h3>

<p>CommonJS is a style you may be familiar with if you’re written anything in Node (which uses a slight variant).  It’s also been gaining traction on the frontend with Browserify.</p>

<p>Using the same format as before, here’s what our <code>foo</code> module looks like in CommonJS:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>

<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
<a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a>
<strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">//    filename: foo.js</span>

<span class="comment">//    dependencies</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="predefined">$</span> = require(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">jquery</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);

<span class="comment">//    methods</span>
<span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">myFunc</span>(){};

<span class="comment">//    exposed public method (single)</span>
module.exports = myFunc;
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>And our more complicate example, with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>

module.exports = {

    <span class="key">c</span>: c
};
</pre></td>

<h3 id="umd-universal-module-definition">UMD: Universal Module Definition</h3>

<p>Since CommonJS and AMD styles have both been equally popular, it seems there’s yet no consensus.  This has brought about the push for a “universal” pattern that supports both styles, which brings us to none other than the Universal Module Definition.</p>

<p>The pattern is admittedly ugly, but is both AMD and CommonJS compatible, as well as supporting the old-style “global” variable definition:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>

</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">function</span> (root, factory) {
    <span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="keyword">typeof</span> define === <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">function</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> &amp;&amp; define.amd) {
        <span class="comment">// AMD</span>
        define([<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">jquery</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>], factory);

    <span class="comment">//    exposed public method</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> myFunc;
}));
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>And keeping in the same pattern as the above examples, the more complicated case with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ChristianHeilmann/posts/Tkpqip4uZpB"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/paul-irish-native-apps-eating-our-lunch.png" /></a></p>

<p>What you tried to read above was not entirely different from my once-a-year curiosity visit to Yahoo’s mobile homepage (ok, minus the jab at the much-hated Tapatalk).  During the course of one visit and one search, those really are all the prompts which got in the way of what I was trying to accomplish on the site.</p>

<p>While I’d love to pick on Yahoo in particular, mobile users know this common experience all too well.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that the primary content of many mobile sites is now a big giant “Download the app here” button.  How strange that we find ourseles in a world where the secondary content is that which the user is actually interested in.</p>

<h3 id="native-vs-web">Native vs. Web</h3>
<p>Like most things, we humans like to create dichotomies, and we did the same with native and web, persistently thinking them to be mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>For a short time, it seemed, contrary to mobile platforms that came before, that the revolutionary smartphone of 2007 would have developers creating a flurry of web apps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps <em>that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone</em>. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services. They can make a call, they can send an email, they can look up a location on Google Maps. And guess what? There’s no SDK that you need! You’ve got everything you need if you know how to write apps using the most modern web standards to write amazing apps for the iPhone today. So developers, we think we’ve got a very sweet story for you. You can begin building your iPhone apps today. (<a href="http://youtu.be/8Vq993Td6ys?t=37s">Steve Jobs at WWDC 2007</a>, emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, even in that keynote you can see shades of web apps being pitted against native apps.  And what would both developers and consumers rather have: an emulated native experience, or a true native experience?  Most folks have always wanted the latter, and the latter has consistently delivered a better user experience.</p>

<p>Very talented developers have created “native-like” experiences on the web, including the old iPhone user guide (powered by <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2009/pastrykit-digging-into-an-apple-pie/">PastryKit</a>), but all along it’s been native apps which have required less effort and less clever tricks for smooth user interfaces.  However, this being said, it should also be noted that many native apps today actually have a web view component, and end users are often unaware of this fact.</p>

<p>In 2007, after the release of the first iPhone, the web app vision was soon abandoned after a somewhat lackluster and uncoordinated response from us developers.  Apple also realized the monetary potential of native apps and a wildly successful centralized App Store, a path that’s led us to our current situation:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/109749/Apps-Solidify-Leadership-Six-Years-into-the-Mobile-Revolution"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/apps-dominate.jpg" alt="Apps Continue to Dominate the Mobile Web: 2013 saw 80% of time spent in apps and 20% of time on the mobile web, whereas 2014 is currently seeing 86% app usage and 14% mobile web usage." /></a></p>

<h3 id="keep-calm-and-carry-on-">Keep Calm and Carry On… ?</h3>
<p>The web isn’t going away anytime soon, and that means the mobile web is also here to stay, even if less people are using it.  But it unfortunately means less emphasis on mobile experiences, which means less demand for mobile web developers.</p>

<p>It means that the mobile web, and probably the larger web as a whole, will only be considered as an afterthought, if considered at all.  We’ve already witnessed this happening with the mobile web being considered a sort of sub/side topic of responsive web design.</p>

<p>Just for fun, I wanted to reproduce a cool but completely superfluous UI I saw in the updated Foursquare app recently. Basically, when the user tries to scroll past the upper bound of the app/page, the header image becomes blurred.</p>

<p>We can do the same thing on the web by listening for negative scroll and then using (abusing?) CSS filters.</p>

<p>Note that there’s an extra trick for iOS, which presents problems I had forgotten about (namely, no negative scroll, and a scroll listener which fires once at the end of scrolling). That’s why I had to throw in some extra logic for touchstart/touchmove/touchend.</p>

<h4 id="explanation-1">Explanation</h4>

<p>Again, no sanitization needed here because i is guaranteed to be an integer. The solution relies on an understanding of the modulus function - this is something usually learned in school, but something I haven’t had to use since, except in interviews or quizzes. Or quizzes during interviews.</p>

<p>Basically, think of modulus as “remainder” function for division problems. For instance, <code>4 % 2</code> will give a modulus of <code>1</code> because 4 goes into 2 twice, evenly, with zero remainder. On the other hand, <code>5 % 2</code> will give a modulus of <code>1</code> because 5 goes into 2 twice, with a remainder of 1. This turns out to be a handy way to differentiate even (4) and odd (5) numbers.</p>

<p>(note that the <code>else</code> isn’t needed here, but it gives greater clarity to what’s going on)</p>

</div>

<h4 id="explanation-2">Explanation</h4>

<p>Now we’re getting a bit tougher!</p>

<p>Strings have a handy function that splits them into an array: <code>split()</code>. For instance,</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">foo.bar.baz</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>.split(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">.</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>)
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>will output</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>[<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">foo</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">bar</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">baz</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>]
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Notice that the periods have been removed, just as the prompt asked for!</p>

<p>In this case we need to first check if there was no file extension. This means that there were no periods to split on, resulting in a one-member array (<code>"foo".split(".")</code> becomes <code>["foo"]</code>). In this case we return <code>false</code>, as the prompt asks for.</p>

<p>Now, in the else case, we know that the array must be larger than 1, meaning that it has a file extension. Since the file extension is always at the end, we know that it must be the last member in the array.</p>

<p>We can find the index of the last member by taking into account array length (<code>filenameArray.length</code>) and the fact that the array is zero-indexed, meaning that we need to subtract 1 from this length. Now we know the extension exists and is at the end of the array, so all we need to do is return it:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>

  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">return</span> filenameArray[filenameArray.length - <span class="integer">1</span>];

            longest = n[i];
        }
    }   
}
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<h4 id="explanation-3">Explanation</h4>

<p>This is a pretty classic interview question. It’s fairly easy and straightforward: just keep track of the longest string in a variable, then loop through all the members of the array. If the current member is longer, set it as the new longest string. At the end, return whatever that variable contains.</p>

<p>Note the extra sanitization check here to make sure the type is a string. If it’s not a string, we <code>continue</code> to continue to the next iteration of the <code>for</code> loop. (Note that this is similar to returning early in functions)</p>

<h4 id="explanation-4">Explanation</h4>

<p>The best way to handle this one is through recursion, which is tricky but powerful. I admit that on my first attempts writing it in the console, my browser froze up and I had to restart it.</p>

<p>Recursive functions are very elegant but tricky. It helps to step through with examples.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with <code>arraySum(1)</code>. The output is of course 1, but note that we didn’t actually input an array. The code took the first codepath in the <code>if</code> statement (because <code>typeof 1 === "number"</code> is true)</p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we input a basic array:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>arraySum([<span class="integer">1</span>]);  <span class="comment">// 1</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Again the answer is 1, but this time the codepath was different. This time <code>Array.isArray([1])</code> was true, and the function was called recursively for each of the members in the array. That is to say, each member of the array (in this case the single member) was sent to arraySum as a simple integer. So the recursive call was the same as the original example: <code>arraySum(1)</code>, and the output was the same.</p>

<p>In the case of more numbers, the outputs are all added to the <code>sum</code> and then returned back at the end of the function.</p>

<p>Note that this works quite well for even deeply nested arrays, since arraySum() has logic for arrays that will always return the sum of all of its deeply nested integers:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>arraySum([<span class="integer">1</span>, [<span class="integer">2</span>,[<span class="integer">3</span>,[<span class="integer">4</span>,[<span class="integer">5</span>]]]]]);   <span class="comment">// 15</span>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I came back from Japan and accepted an offer to work at a startup in Silicon Valley, I knew one of the biggest challenges would be to find a decent and affordable apartment in Mountain View, close to where I’d be working. I had it all planned out, and how healthy and convenient it would be to walk to work and also Mountain View downtown!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this dream was shared by me and hundreds of thousands of other like-minded software engineers. Which isn’t unexpected, really. If you spend enough time in Silicon Valley, everyone’s ideas start to sound the same after a while.</p>

<p>Mountain View, if you didn’t already know, is home to the now omnipresent non-evil company known as Google. Google has been fast taking over Mountain View, building by building, campus extension by campus extension. They even have their name on the sidewalks near where I take walks at work. Because they own those, too. (Actually, they own the fiber connections running beneath them).</p>

<p>One day I went out apartment hunting and was pretty happy the apartment listed earlier in the day hadn’t already sold, as had happened several times earlier (yes, there is THAT much competition).</p>

<p>As I drove up and approached the apartment, I noticed the unwelcoming stare of a single woman waiting outside the complex. She didn’t say anything, so I mentioned that she must be waiting for the apartment walk-through the same as myself. She acknowledged and then mentioned that “he was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago”, referring to the current tenant who was supposed to show up earlier for an apartment viewing.</p>

<p>I saw that she was pretty serious about maintaining that she was here first, and I cracked a joke about folks being cutthroat because of the competition or some such thing, to try to break the tension. I even said it with a smile, which is supposed to prompt at least a crack of a smile in any human capable of empathy. Sadly it had no effect on this poor emotionless woman. It was clear that she was all business.</p>

<p>It’s not dissimilar to the animal kingdom, really. She was just establishing her dominance by passively explaining that she was here before I was. Oh I see, so even if I wanted this place, I’d have no shot at it, because you were here first? I guess that’s what you have to do these days to ensure you get a place…</p>

<p>I hear it’s worse in “The City®” (San Francisco), and I’m not surprised really. The last time I was looking for apartments there, it was a crappy little studio apartment in a crappy part of town, with what looked like 20 people lined up ahead of me to put down a deposit. No thank you. Sometimes I think I’d rather live someplace in the country.</p>

<p>Alright, back to my apartment hunting story in Mountain View. I figured I might as well take a look at the place, since I’d taken the time to come by. Some other folks showed up and started waiting in the same spot, until finally the current tenant came by, apologized for the wait, and took us through the apartment.</p>

<p>To be honest, the apartment was nothing special. It was an older apartment that was part of a fourplex with families with kids on all sides. Not exactly a quiet place. Sure, there was nice lush greenery everywhere, and of course it was conveniently situated in Mountain View, but it was overall not exceptional. But in a bubble economy, the location is now sufficient to make anything special and worth the price.</p>

<p>I asked the current tenant about cable internet availability, and the single woman decided to use her God-given right to interrupt and respond: “The entire city of Mountain View has WiFi provided for free by Google”. Without missing a beat, she added some other talking points as if they were coming out of a pre-prepared handbook. It actually kind of sounded like someone reciting a memorized passage from the Bible. And there was a certain pride behind it, to give me a hint that I need not ask if she worked for the blasted company.</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to say other than, “Oh, that’s cool”. I really wasn’t prepared to deal with corporate shills on what had become an epic search for an apartment.</p>

<p>After looking around a bit more, I was the second to last person to talk to the owner and take an application. He was more than patient with me, but I noticed the very last person waiting in the shadows to talk to him was The Google Bitch. Dammit, so she had some scheme she was waiting to thrust on the poor guy.</p>

<p>As I walked away and went back to my car, still within earshot The Google Bitch made an offer to the guy: “So, I am prepared to put down money today to secure this apartment” she said confidently. The current tenant just said “Wow, ok” and they talked from there.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I never turned in the application, as it would’ve just been a waste of everyone’s time.</p>

<p>I have since settled into an apartment community in Sunnyvale, where I have been adopted by a very extended, loving Indian family. They sometimes give me funny looks when I walk through the complex, but it’s all good. Perhaps the farther from The Google Bitch and people like her, the better.</p>

				Fourth of July Letter to My Government</a>

		<p>(this is a copy of a letter which I’ve sent to various representatives in government)</p>

<p>As a concerned citizen, I know you understand that I must occasionally voice my concern through letters such as this. My hope is that you will honestly consider my claims and take action on my part. I honestly appreciate you taking your time to seriously consider this letter.</p>

<p>I’m writing to you today specifically in response to abuses by the NSA overstepping its bounds. Citizens of the United States and citizens of the world now know its private data is being indiscriminately collected, sifted through, and intruded upon by the NSA. These actions are clearly antithetical to our own Constitution and set a terrible precedent for the future of this country and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Today is the Fourth of July. However, this Fourth of July is a bit different for me. Instead of setting off fireworks and spending time with my family, I am alone in Japan. Yet I am not alone in my concerns that my constitutional rights are being forced away from me.</p>

<p>As you well know, there are protests today in support of restoring the fourth amendment and against organizations such as the NSA which subvert our Constitution in the name of national security. I sincerely wish I could join these rallies, but I must show support by other means, such as through this letter. While I admit it would be interesting to protest the Japanese way, parked at a street intersection shouting my protests through a megaphone, it seems more effective for me to write directly to you. And to other people such as you who have the full time job of representing me and people like myself.</p>

<p>While the US has never been a perfect country, I know it’s had better times. I’m not the only one who believes our nation is now in a bad way. Yet I hope to do my small part to help fix some of these problems in my lifetime, in order to make America a better place for us all. Since we are both Americans, I hope we share this common interest.</p>

<p>My growing list of grievances is too much to list here, therefore I want to focus on recent revelations by whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden. This has been a tipping point for me and many fellow Americans, whom I hope have also been awoken from a dogmatic slumber.</p>

<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, as a result I’ve started to become more of a believer in America. Or rather, what America is intended to be. I’ve recently found myself reading more about the history of my country. I’ve become interested in politics, and for the first time in my life I’ve seriously considered joining a protest. I have become a better citizen in the hope for a better America.</p>

<p>President Obama and others in positions of power have defended these NSA spying programs, responding by explaining that they have come into effect through lawful means. Yet there has been massive public backlash, which I believe should at least warrant a reconsideration of these surveillance programs. I trust people like you to make sure this happens.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that this hasn’t been the first time in recent years the great disconnect between the governed and the government has been exposed. Perhaps our representatives are not really representing our interests after all? The situation isn’t dissimilar to what culminated in the breaking off and founding of our nation in the first place.</p>

<p>It will be a great shame, but perhaps we are part of the generation which collectively allowed the great American experiment to fail?</p>

<p>Update (July 12, 2013):</p>

<p>I received a reply from one of my senators, Diane Fienstein. While it’s a generic reply sent to everyone sending letters similar to my own (http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/nsa-programs), I appreciate some sort of response.</p>

<p>I’m still concerned however. Fienstein argued her case with the same defense as Obama: our repesentatives in the House and Senate voted these spying initiatives into law. Therefore it’s “legal” and was created and approved by people we voted into law.</p>

<p>This is supposed to dissuade my fears in some way, but it actually makes me more apprehensive. Where are the people in government that represent me and my fears? Where are the people in Congress to re-examine the work they’ve made of the Constitution?</p>

				NSA&#8217;s PRISM: From the Minds of Conspiracy Nuts, Turns Out to Be Reality</a>

		<p>The real shame about NSA/PRISM is that everyone will forget about it next week or next month. Just like we forgot about Trapwire and other endless abuses in the name of protecting society.</p>

<p>The US is now a nation too mentally castrated to do anything about these obvious constitutional abuses. Why are we only capable of short-lived and impotent protest attempts like Occupy? How did we get to be so sedated through this anesthesia of modern consumerism and entertainment?</p>

<p>As of today, it’s no longer just a thought confined to the head of some crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>UPDATE:<br />
Today <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22820711">President Obama defended the spy programs (cell phone and internet espionage)</a>, directly against <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6fnfVJzZT4">his campaign promises (video from 2007)</a>, in I suppose a true political fashion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Google</a> CEOs appeared to have denied involvement using carefully constructed statements. One of the commenter’s on Mark Zuckerberg’s post made the observation that his is a carbon copy of Larry Page’s, which is indeed very strange.</p>

<p>Here’s the statements side-by-side, emphasis mine.</p>

<h3 id="part-1-introduction">Part 1: Introduction</h3>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0.25em 0 0;">

  <p>
    Dear Google users—
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may be aware of press reports alleging that Internet companies have joined a secret U.S. government program called PRISM to give the National Security Agency direct access to our servers. As Google&#8217;s CEO and Chief Legal Officer, we wanted you to have the facts.
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    I want to respond personally to the outrageous press reports about PRISM:
  </p>

<h3 style="clear:both; margin-top: 1em;">
  Part 2: Deny direct involvement with any government program
</h3>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0.25em 0 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Google</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First, we have not joined any program that would give the U.S. government—or any other government—direct access to our servers. Indeed, the U.S. government does not have <b>direct access</b> or a &#8220;back door&#8221; to the information stored in our data centers. <b>We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday</b>.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631">Facebook</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Facebook is not and has never been part of any program to give the US or any other government <b>direct access to our servers</b>. We have never received a blanket request or court order from any government agency asking for information or metadata in bulk, like the one Verizon reportedly received. And if we did, we would fight it aggressively. <b>We hadn&#8217;t even heard of PRISM before yesterday</b>.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 style="clear:both; margin-top: 1em;">
  Part 3: Emphasize that data given to the government is on a case-by-case basis and in compliance with the law
</h3>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0.25em 0 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Google</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Second, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law. Our legal team <b>reviews each and every request</b>, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or don&#8217;t follow the <b>correct process</b>. Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users&#8217; data are false, period. Until this week&#8217;s reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon received—an order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users&#8217; call records. We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users&#8217; Internet activity on such a scale is completely false.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631">Facebook</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When governments ask Facebook for data, <b>we review each request</b> carefully to make sure they always follow the <b>correct processes</b> and all applicable laws, and then only provide the information if is required by law. We will continue fighting aggressively to keep your information safe and secure.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 style="clear:both; margin-top: 1em;">
  Part 4: Recommend more government transparency
</h3>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0.25em 0 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Google</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, this episode confirms what we have long believed—there needs to be a more <b>transparent</b> approach. Google has worked hard, within the confines of the current laws, to be open about the data requests we receive. We post this information on our Transparency Report whenever possible. We were the first company to do this. And, of course, we understand that the U.S. and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens&#8217; safety—including sometimes by using surveillance. But the level of secrecy around the current legal procedures undermines the <b>freedoms we all cherish</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Posted by Larry Page, CEO and David Drummond, Chief Legal Officer
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="width: 49%; float: left; margin: 1em 0;">
  <p>
    (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631">Facebook</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We strongly encourage all governments to be much more <b>transparent</b> about all programs aimed at keeping the public safe. It&#8217;s the only way to protect everyone&#8217;s civil liberties and create the safe and <b>free society we all want</b> over the long term.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure if this is conspiracy or just laziness, but I would guess the latter. Both responses have similar wording (which is admittedly sometimes unavoidable) and are organized in the same three-part format, with the same talking point for each section.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The other day I glanced at a classmate using <a href="http://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> to perform an image search and was impressed with their presentation:</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baidu-mobile-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baidu-mobile-image-search.jpg" alt="Baidu mobile image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1163" /></a></p>

<p>Note the nice big images and the lack of margins around images. After seeing this presentation, I realized that the common approach of adding margins around images is pretty unnecessary.</p>

<p>I also noticed that the images are a variety of sizes, leading to a less sterile experience. There’s surely some clever math going on behind the scenes here to make sure the images appear “justified” (to use a word from the recent Flickr redesign).</p>

<h3 id="google">Google</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-mobile-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-mobile-image-search.jpg" alt="Google mobile image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1166" /></a></p>

<p>Note the smaller photos, which sometimes causes features on images to be indiscernable.</p>

<p>Also note the more common approach of adding margins around the images. This seems to remove a lot of space which could otherwise be used to show more details of images, which is the approach Baidu takes.</p>

<h3 id="bing">Bing</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bing-mobile-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bing-mobile-image-search.jpg" alt="Bing mobile image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1169" /></a></p>

<p>Bing uses a nicely-designed slick interface with a black background, which I tend to like a bit better.</p>

<p>However, all its images are cropped or resized to be exactly the same size, leading to a more sterile gridlike experience.</p>

<p>Also, just a minor complaint, but the search magnifying glass appears to be a tiny bit blurry, especially compared to the sharpness of the Bing logo. But it’s barely noticeable, especially compared to Yahoo (below).</p>

<h3 id="yahoo">Yahoo!</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yahoo-mobile-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yahoo-mobile-image-search.jpg" alt="Yahoo mobile image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1167" /></a></p>

<p>Yahoo has nice big images, actually a bit too big. Bit it also appears to suffer from the approach Bing uses to resize photos to make their dimensions exactly the same.</p>

<p>Again note the common white margins around the images.</p>

<p>The non-retina top graphics (logo and search button) are so blurry and distracting that I have to at least mention them here. These images look blurry on every modern phone on the market today, and it’s sad to me that neither developers nor QA cared enough about this to do something about it.</p>

<p>Strangely, these images look fine on the main “Web” tab, but they are distractingly blurry on this Images view as well as others.</p>

<h3 id="flickr-mobile-app-ios">Flickr mobile app (iOS)</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-app-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-app-image-search.jpg" alt="Flickr mobile app image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1164" /></a></p>

<p>The Flickr app itself has some decently-sized images, but here again we see the image margins at work. This is also present on the “justified view” on the desktop site, so I suppose they wanted to be consistent.</p>

<h3 id="flickr-mobile-web">Flickr mobile web</h3>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-web-image-search.jpg"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-web-image-search.jpg" alt="Flickr mobile web image search" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1165" /></a></p>

<p>This is certainly the worst out of the bunch. It’s a real waste of space, with small images sacrificed for textual information that’s a little excessive for this screen.</p>

<p>I think this is just due to the website’s age. Flickr’s mobile website is much neglected and is showing its age. I would be really nice to see updates to match the nice progress they’ve made with the “justified layout” that you can see on their desktop site and mobile app.</p>

<p>Japan has a healthy fascination with the beauty of nature, and this includes the ephemeral cherry blossoms. And one of the prime locations for cherry blossoms is Kyoto, Japan.</p>

<p>It takes a while to realize, but there actually seems to be a wide variety of cherry blossoms which blossom at different times. This stretches the season out a bit (the prime blossoming lasts only about a week). It’s nice to be able to walk around for a few weeks and find random beautiful cherry blossoms.</p>
