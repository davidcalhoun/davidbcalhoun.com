		<p>Several times I’ve heard the phrase “the religion of your parents’ choosing”, used to scoff at adherents to various religions, as if they had no intelligent choice in the matter of their own beliefs. As the thought goes, religious standing (or lack thereof) should be a personal matter, one to be decided rationally (yes, there is such a thing as rational faith; to say otherwise is to label all religious people as fideists, which is a mistake) by individuals, apart from their social group if possible.</p>

<p>How strange then not to carry this philosophy into more of our social behaviors. Why should we then avoid phrases such as “the culture/land of your parents’ choosing”?</p>

<p>It seems to me that this carries the same implications as religious belief. For instance, permenently moving to another country is in a sense turning one’s back on their upbringing and their whole social group. Of course this isn’t a total turning away: a person might return to one’s home country after many years, just as they might return to their faith after many years away.</p>

<p>Both of these moves seem only possible after exposure to different ways of thinking, something increasingly made possible as the modern world progresses. It should be of little surprise then that more people will test the waters of other faiths, or lack of faith, just as they may test the waters of living in a different culture. It seems increasingly easy to do, especially in a highly individual-centered culture. Trying a new career or a new life may be a challenge, but it might have the same motive as turning over in bed: the current position has become uncomfortable, and a new position becomes increasingly more alluring.</p>

<p>Some people may stay in their new culture, new career, new faith – their new way of life – and some may eventually return.</p>

<p>Either way they are forever changed, and hopefully for the better: hardened by experience and permanently viewing the world through a different lens.</p>

<p>Either way I think is better than not having ventured out at all.</p>

<em>“…but the hackers will not find intelligence of corporations and governments, or signs of a vast conspiracy…” -Stratfor CEO George Friedman, January 2012</em></p>

<p>…eight months later…</p>

<p><em>“WIKILEAKS: Surveillance Cameras Around The Country Are Being Used In A Huge Spy Network” -Business Insider, August 2012</em></p>

<p>In case you haven’t noticed, there been some big news released recently as a result of another release of documents by Wikileaks on August 9, 2012. The documents are [emails from the global intelligence company Stratfor][2]. The most recent release has confirmed what many conspiracy theorists have feared for years: that the government is operating a vast secret surveillance network that is collecting data on citizens and their movements.</p>

<p>The news has been surprisingly (or unsurprisingly?) absent from major news sources, so I’ve collected a few of the major articles here:</p>

<p>[http://www.salon.com/2012/08/10/biggest_story_you_missed_7/][3]<br />
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trapwire-everything-you-need-to-know-2012-8">http://www.businessinsider.com/trapwire-everything-you-need-to-know-2012-8</a><br />

<a href="http://reason.com/blog/2012/08/10/creepy-spying-system-revealed-by-wikilea">http://reason.com/blog/2012/08/10/creepy-spying-system-revealed-by-wikilea</a></p>

<p>And here’s a link to the mirror of the recent Wikileaks email release: <a href="http://mirror2.wikileaks-press.org/gifiles/releasedate/2012-08-09.html">http://mirror2.wikileaks-press.org/gifiles/releasedate/2012-08-09.html</a></p>

<p>Though this has been suspected for a while now, I read the news with a huge sinking feeling. Conspiracy theories always have the virtue of the remote possibility of being wrong. But now with the theory confirmed, it appears that global surveillance has been implemented on a scale and degree much worse than CCTV ever was or could’ve been, with a technology purportedly much more sophisticated than just facial recognition. I fear the genie has escaped the bottle, and it will be impossible to put it back in again.</p>

<p>The technology itself has been created by TrapWire, a company which, according to the leaked emails, supplies both the US government and various companies with surveillance equipment. (Side note: interestingly enough, the technology bears a striking resemblance to a controversial new technology [INDECT][5], apparently in use in the EU since 2009).</p>

<p>TrapWire actually has a [website][6] on which it outlines, on first glance, its [well-intentioned philosophy][7]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most modern critical infrastructure and asset protection programs are focused on improving perimeter security, access control, and incident response. While prudent, these physical security measures are reactive — designed to mitigate the effects of an attack, rather than prevent the incident from occurring in the first place. At TrapWire, we have shown that we can achieve better results, and do so much more cost effectively, by shifting the focus from mitigation to prevention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, preventative measures are both more cost-effective and more effective in general. Actually, I think most folks would agree with this. Considered alone, of course we would like to be able to prevent crimes before they occur.</p>

<p>However, if the tradeoff is living in a state of constant surveillance, I believe the cost to be too great.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I believe any actions to create a state of constant, unwarranted surveillance is directly contradictory to the spirit in which our nation was founded, for what it’s worth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I’m not sure that is worth much in general these days.</p>

<p>I hope that quote [rings familiar][8], because I fear as time marches on, those words will ring less and less familiar, until they are stamped out completely and disappear into the vague memory of the past.</p>

<p>Already I fear that the powers that be are trying to distract us and prevent us from hearing the TrapWire news and making an informed judgement for ourselves.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Wikileaks has been under massive DDoS attacks since the beginning of the month, resulting in their site being inaccessible. In all fairness, these attacks started occurring before the latest email leak on August 9, but there is something undeniably fishy about the timing of the attacks.</p>

<p>There is also something very fishy about the group that’s taken responsibility for the attacks on Wikileaks: a purported new group called AntiLeaks, whose leader released [this statement on August 8][9]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can call me DietPepsi. I am the leader of AntiLeaks. We are not doing this to call attention to ourselves. We are young adults, citizens of the United States of America and are deeply concerned about the recent developments with Julian Assange and his attempt at aslyum in Ecuador.</p>

  <p>Assange is the head of a new breed of terrorist. We are doing this as a protest against his attempt to escape justice into Ecuador. This would be a catalyst for many more like him to rise up in his place. We will not stop and they will not stop us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have the keen ability to spot bad actors while watching movies or TV shows. I also detect some bad acting here, and so do most other folks.</p>

<p>In all, it seems quite Orwellian, and it seems clear that someone doesn’t want us to find out about their Orwellian plots. Perhaps they would’ve attracted less attention if they were more forthcoming and transparent? But now people are rightfully curious as ever.</p>

<p>It’ll be interesting what will become of this, but at this point I’ve become a bit pessimistic. I think this will pass and be forgotten, along with the Occupy Movement and any other glimpse of true hope and true change that could come to this country.</p>

<p>Perhaps all this is leading me back to the stark realization that it is time to follow in the steps of my ancestors and leave my country in search of a new and better one? In search of a better life?</p>

		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>(check out the <strong><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/webkit-search-cancel-button.html">Demo</a></strong>)</p>

<p>A while back I had a bit of a field day <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/implementing-iphone-slider-unlock-with-input-type-range">messing around with input type=”range”</a>, trying to replicate the “unlock slider” on iOS using CSS, targeting special WebKit-only CSS pseudoelements such as webkit-slider-thumb.</p>

<p>Well, now I’m at it again, this time with a much simpler use case, trying to implement a custom “clear” button on search field inputs (note that this only works on input type=”search”):</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/webkit-search-cancel-button.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/custom-webkit-search-cancel-button.png" alt="Custom webkit-search-cancel-button" title="Custom webkit-search-cancel-button" width="239" height="145" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914" /></a></p>

<h3 id="details-about-the-implementation">Details about the implementation</h3>

<p>It turns out this is relatively easy to do, and is somewhat supported, at least in the latest Chrome and Safari 6. Note that it does work on iOS6, but not on iOS5, but the positioning is slightly different from the other implementations. No idea about Android, so I’ll leave that for someone else to find out. <img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>So how do we do it? First, we need the special WebKit CSS pseudoselector (<code>-webkit-search-cancel-button</code>), and secondly, we need to use that to wipe out the default WebKit styling (with -webkit-appearance: none;):</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="pseudo-class">::-webkit-search-cancel-button</span> {   // <span class="key">select</span> <span class="key">all</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">X</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="key">buttons</span> <span class="key">in</span> <span class="key">search</span> <span class="key">inputs</span>
    <span class="key">-webkit-appearance</span>: <span class="value">none</span>;      // <span class="key">hide</span> <span class="key">the</span> <span class="key">default</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">X</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="key">button</span>
}
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>You would think that the next step might be adding our own custom background-image to this element, but unfortunately it won’t work that easily (of course).</p>

<p>What we need now is a little bit of trickery, using an <code>:after</code> pseudoclass on the pseduoclass (!?). The result is a bit of “pseudoclass Inception”:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>

<p>So it turns out you can still whatever you like in there really, even text content (see the last text input in the <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/webkit-search-cancel-button.html">demo</a>). You may even need to tweak the positioning a bit, in which case you can learn from the same example (you will need to set position:relative on the cancel button itself to anchor the position:absolute <code>:after</code> content – check out the code).</p>

<h3 id="final-notes">Final notes</h3>

<p>Note that this is just an experiment, not a robust use case that I’m recommending as a cross-browser solution (obviously, since it’s WebKit-only).</p>

<p>In the case of wanting to implement something similar cross-browser, I recommend absolutely-positioning a button element over an input element, then adding the appropriate right-padding to the input as necessary, then hooking up the “clear all text” behavior with the help of JavaScript.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After work today, I stopped by the old bustling Apple Store in Palo Alto. I was there for a bit of a peek at what my next blank check to Apple would bring me.</p>

<p>I was between tables going back and forth between the updated MacBook Pro (non-retina) and the Retina MacBook Pro and came away with some initial impressions. I couldn’t find these sort of “impartial” impressions elsewhere, so I thought I’d record these impressions for myself.</p>

<h3 id="prima-facie">Prima facie</h3>

<p>Initial thoughts: the screen seemed to be slightly more crisp, especially the icons in the dock. However, the form factor made more of an impression than the screen: the laptop is significantly lighter than previous models I’ve used (for the record, I use a late 2008 MBP at home, and have been using newer MacBook Pros for work purposes). I picked up the laptop expecting it to be nearly as heavy as what I’m used to, and overcompensated when lifting it up. That’s a good thing.</p>

<p>The lady at the store opened up iPhoto and showed me a few photos. It seemed to be crisper, but nothing like the noticeable difference when I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS to an iPhone 4S. She also opened up the Apple homepage on the Retina display and on a non-Retina, and pointed out a specific piece of text. In this case it was text in a graphic. We had to shuffle back and forth in order to be convinced. In this case we were actually looking at the text on a graphic on the Apple site):</p>

<p><a href="http://images.apple.com/home/images/macbookpro_title.png"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/non-retina.png" alt="Non-retina text" title="Non-retina text" width="374" height="124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://images.apple.com/home/images/macbookpro_title_2x.png"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/retina.png" alt="Retina text" title="Retina text" width="748" height="248" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906" /></a></p>

<p>Non-retina (top) and Retina (bottom) graphics at native resolution.</p>

<p>(technical note: the Retina version is served via JavaScript – see <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/how-apple-com-will-serve-retina-images-to-new-ipads/">http://blog.cloudfour.com/how-apple-com-will-serve-retina-images-to-new-ipads/</a>)</p>

<h3 id="good-for-photo-editing">Good for photo editing?</h3>

<p>The differences in the text and dock icons was easier to see than the difference between photos in iPhoto. As an amateur photographer, I’m unsure if this makes a difference. When editing photos, instead of zooming my head closer to the screen I end up leaving my head stationary and zooming with controls in the photo editing program I use. The Retina screen makes the experience a bit nicer, but obviously isn’t a requirement for producing good detailed photos. For photographers, I think there’s an apt analogy. The Retina screen is kind of like an expensive lens: it definitely help, but it won’t guarantee good photos, and not all good photos are necessarily taken with good lenses.</p>

<h3 id="application-support-or-lack-thereof">Application support (or lack thereof)</h3>

<p>One thing that was also evident is that not everything is ready for the Retina screen. Photoshop surprisingly didn’t support it, even though the saleslady mentioned they had an early look at the Retina MacBook Pro. Surprisingly, not even the Apple Store greeting/icons on the demo mode laptops was ready for the screen (it was visibly pixelated).</p>

<p>The guy next to me predictably loaded up Microsoft Word and complained about it looking ugly (apparently he got the memo and wanted to act surprised). Like other programs, it’s just a matter of time until they fix it. Whatever, I can deal with that.</p>

<p>I tried to load up YouTube in Safari, but I didn’t have a good 1080p video to test (for the record, I tried this one, which doesn’t look too great at 1080p: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjC72RIDt_A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjC72RIDt_A</a>). I’ll have to try again later.</p>

<h3 id="testing-out-different-viewing-distances">Testing out different viewing distances</h3>

<p>Lastly, I tried several viewing distance tests. I found that at my normal viewing distance (sorry I don’t have measurements) I could definitely tell that things were a little sharper, but again, the difference was slight. As I moved back, it didn’t take long for the difference to be indiscernible compared to the non-Retina screen. Starting again from normal viewing distance, the closer I got, the easier it was to tell that it was a “Retina” screen. In my mind, there’s a logical reason “Retina” came first to the iPhone, then the iPad, and now the MacBook Pro, in that order. It simply becomes less discernable at longer viewing distances.</p>

<h3 id="afterthoughts-impact-on-web-development">Afterthoughts: impact on web development?</h3>

<p>At least on my initial impression, it didn’t seem that the new Retina screen necessitated too much of a change in websites offering higher-resolution graphics. They can get along just fine not upgrading, but I suppose folks will enjoy high-res graphics when they see it.</p>

<p>It’s now been a few years after the iPhone 4 was released, and years since high pixel density Android phones have been on the market, and I still still see noticeably blurry graphics on mobile sites. Hopefully at the greater viewing distance afforded by the MacBook Pro, there will be less of a shock at seeing the contrast between sharp text and a blurry photo. Perhaps a laptop is a nice compromise: good enough to enjoy “Retina” graphics where supported, but not too distracting when graphics aren’t optimized for the high pixel density.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-too-long-didn8217t-read">TLDR (Too long, didn’t read)</h3>

<p>TLDR/Conclusion: the light form factor was more of a sell for me than the Retina screen. Though the Retina screen is nice, it’s hard to justify the purchase on that alone. However, the purchase becomes justified when coupled with a nice processor bump and nice form factor. Since I’ve been waiting to upgrade for a while, it’s only a matter of time before I get one. But as I don’t NEED one yet, I’ll wait until prices drop a bit (as they always do).</p>

		<p>I have been learning bits and pieces of Japanese throughout the years, and picking up more and more on each of my trips to Japan. But now it’s time to buckle down and get disciplined about learning, and make some real progress.</p>

<p>As with learning any language, having a decent vocabulary is critical in order to form coherent sentences, so I’ve decided to focus on this for the time being, in addition to learning hiragana and katakana and getting it down pat, with no errors.</p>

<p>You may already be familiar with the JLPT, the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, which has difficulty ranges between 1-5, with 1 being the most difficult. So let’s start together at JLPT 5. <img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.japanmoji.com/2010/07/vocabulary-list.html">this site</a>, I’ve use the following first 50 vocabulary words and <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/b/jlpt5-vocabulary-1-50.mp3">recorded myself</a> going through them so I can commit these to memory (many I already know, which is a good thing I suppose!). Of course I will be speaking only to the best of my ability, so the pronunciation of many words will likely be off in some way or another. In any case, it should be useful to listen to on repeat to get these drilled into my head! I’ve uploaded my recording for your convenience, but note again that the pronunciation isn’t perfect, and this is a free service, so don’t complain. <img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				Response to &#8220;What’s Next for Mobile Now That Adaptive Design Has Failed?&#8221;</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There’s been a flurry of response to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/22/adaptive-design-has-failed/">this article, entitled “What’s next for mobile now that adaptive design has failed?”</a>.</p>

<p>There’s many problems with this article, so it’s hard to know where to start.</p>

<p>I will admit that defenders of responsive design have come out of the woodwork in trashing this article, but I suppose I count myself among them, being a proponent of responsive design. I still see the web heading that direction, and I definitely don’t see it heading in the direction the author of the article has described.</p>

<h3 id="adaptive--responsive">Adaptive != Responsive</h3>

<p>Like others have said, adaptive isn’t the same as responsive. I hate that both have become buzzwords to be thrown around by execs, but they should at least be used appropriately. (see <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/web-development/TCH_WDD/961492-23942997">this page</a> for a good discussion of the differences). This article conflates the two.</p>

<p>I’ll assume for the purpose of this argument that we’re referring to responsive design.</p>

<h3 id="unproven-assumption-responsive-design-has-failed">Unproven assumption: responsive design has failed</h3>

<p>There’s an assumption that responsive design has failed, but no argument for it, which means by the end of the article it remains an assumption. I’ll assume its purpose was solely as an attention-seeking headline. Not much more to be said there, so let’s pass over it.</p>

<h3 id="tablets--magazines-vertical-scroll--bad-pagination--good">Tablets = Magazines?, Vertical Scroll = Bad?, Pagination = Good?</h3>

<p>There’s an assumption that users equate tablets to magazines, and therefore expect to swipe through pages. I believe there’s some sort of interaction or deal the author has with Pressly (which he mentions and has retweeted on Twitter), so I can understand why they’d be pushing their agenda and usage model, which is very much of the “iPad-magazine-page-flip” sort.</p>

<p>But there’s a reason pagination is still an optional feature not turned on by default in apps such as Instapaper: it’s because users are very familiar and comfortable with vertical scrolling of content on the web, and possibly in some cases more comfortable than a page-based format. They are as comfortable with vertical scrolling as the author would say they are with turning the pages of a magazine.</p>

<p>I’m the age where I’ve seen the decline of newspapers and magazines and am actually more comfortable with a vertical-scrolling interface as opposed to a page-flipping interface as older folks might be used to in magazines.</p>

<p>Just because the interaction model worked for an older medium doesn’t mean it’ll work or is even the best for new mediums. If that were true, we’d still have rotary dial inputs on our touchscreen phones, simply because some phone exec insisted that users were more familiar and comfortable with the rotary dial interaction model.</p>

<h3 id="users-love-those-full-screen-ads">Users Love Those Full-Screen Ads</h3>

<p>Users do NOT like full-screen ads. To think otherwise can be very rightly said to be a delusion of grandeur. Go to the app store, look at the iPad CNET app reviews, and tell me that users are thrilled about seeing a full-screen ad pop over their content when they open the app. Quite the opposite, that turns out to be the main complaint by a long shot, or at least it was for a long while after the app was released. I know. I was there to see it happen, and to see a blind eye turned toward the problem.</p>

<h3 id="successful-advertising--successful-user-experience">Successful advertising != Successful User Experience</h3>

<p>Advertising isn’t a gauge of user experience. This is the hubris and the downfall of CBS and anyone who believes otherwise. More ad revenue means more aggressive ads, more fullscreen ads, and more ways to trick the user into clicking ads. This is the opposite of a good user experience. The real user base isn’t there to click on ads – they’re there to read content, and everything else is a distraction. This is the catch-22 of this model, and those that don’t see that will never know they need to toe the line and maintain a delicate balance. Worst of all, those who completely miss the point will mistake successful advertising with a successful user experience (which here is as easily conflated as adaptive and responsive design have been).</p>

<p>Sometimes companies don’t realize there’s a point of no return when ads (which are necessary in some minimal form) become too distracting and actually make it more difficult to get to content, resulting in users abandoning the site in the long term, or taking measures to churn the site through AdBlock or Instapaper or other measures that preserve the content, while discarding the distracting bits (usually ads and other tricks to get the user to stay on the site longer by showing “related content”, which is ultimately a way to trick the user into staying to view more ads).</p>

				Why Is Philosophy Still Important?</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This was posted on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/sw0t2/why_is_philosophy_still_important/">reddit</a> recently, so I thought I’d copy my response here.</p>

<p>First, just a quick introduction! There’s been a lot of thought recently that philosophy is useless. The main arguments seem to be that</p>

<ol>
  <li>science has replaced any need for philosophy</li>
  <li>philosophy is a useless subject to study in college</li>
</ol>

<p>For the latter argument, I recently recorded my thoughts, <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/b/2012-03-17-the-value-of-a-philosophy-degree.mp3">and you can hear them here</a>. For the first argument, read on…</p>

<p>In short: science helps us live longer, whereas philosophy helps us live better.</p>

<p>It’s true that there’s a lot of philosophy that is very academic and not so useful, but at its core, philosophy is a striving towards figuring out what is true and worthwhile, and what it means to live a meaningful and worthwhile life. That’s something off-limits for science, because science can tell us how things are empirically, but it can’t prescribe how we should then live.</p>

<p>It so happens that we already believe many things to be true and have many attitudes and dispositions towards things, whether we realize it or not. That’s what you might call a person’s personal philosophy. A person may hate philosophy, but it would be true to say that their “anti-philosophy” is a type of philosophy. In short, we all have a philosophy already. Shouldn’t we then examine it logically and try to improve it, and make sure it gets closer to the truth?</p>

<p>It also happens that our world is saturated with manipulation of people’s philosophies. Advertisements and an envy of other’s belongings has saturated our consumer culture and has turned into a sort of philosophy of its own, and sadly a way of life. There’s also much manipulation of attitudes and thought in politics, which is how politics have turned into a game of image and often times broad, false promises. Money and a lust for fame have also corrupted the sciences to some degree, and have turned it into a bit of a game to get research funding from large corporations, so nothing in the world is off-limits it seems.</p>

<p>Philosophy gives us the tools to recognize these things for what they are, and gives us some defenses against them that the common person might not have. (incidentally, I recommend reading On Bullshit for more of a taste of how our world is saturated in BS)</p>

<p>I believe there’s a few big reasons philosophy is downplayed and ridiculed in our culture today. The main reason is that there’s no real way to make it profitable, unlike the sciences. If we’re living in a consumer culture that assigns some value to things based on money, then naturally we will value less the things which aren’t profitable. When it comes down to it, we really are living in a culture that values more the computer science graduate who goes to join a company such as Zynga to produce banal (borrowing a favorite word from David Foster Wallace) ripoff games. We value this person more than someone who stays in academia to pursue truth and knowledge, and we ridicule them for not coming out into the real world, working a real job, and making a ton of money, which is after all the highest end according to to our current thinking (which is in itself a philosophy).</p>

<p>I have more to say about all this, but I’ll keep this short. <img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>(For a bit of perspective, I’m saying this as someone who makes way more money than I need working for big corporations doing web dev work, but is looking to go back and study more philosophy in school eventually.)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lately I’ve come to terms with the fact I need to try something new in my life – a true change in direction. I anticipate that this blog will take the same direction, so there will likely be less and less “developer” posts and more and more posts of me living this new path. (TLDR: unsubscribe now, probably!)</p>

<p>Why the change in direction? I’ve had my fun, I’ve lived a comfortable life where I really haven’t had to worry about money (yet), but I’ve learned the hard way that buying “stuff” doesn’t buy happiness. It’s trite and it’s something you always hear, but I guess it’s something you have to figure out for yourself, the hard way. I read Walden in high school and thought I’d learned from its lessons. But I re-read it recently and came away completely changed. I can get by with a lot less, and most importantly – with a more meaningful job that pays much less.</p>

<p>I’ve worked at a few big companies and become a somewhat competent (and surely incompetent in some ways) frontend web developer. It’s a great way to grow right out of college and a really comfortable way to live out on your own for a little while. It’s probably a way to continue making a living while supporting a family, but that hasn’t happened to me yet.</p>

<p>And in any case, it’s not for me.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I can’t really say I’ve made a real difference in the world. I can work as hard as I can, but at the end of the day I’m just making websites for entertainment. Which is not to say there aren’t good causes out there, I suppose. And it’s not to say I can’t funnel some of this money into good causes, which I’m been forcing myself to do more and more in very small ways (I seem to be a naturally selfish person, but I’m trying to get better in that respect). But I can’t get past the feeling that my time can be better spent.</p>

<p>Now’s a fantastic time for web development, with so many opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and so many opportunities to publish new findings and pioneer new methods. There will be trailblazers and figureheads, and people making an awesome use of technology. But it won’t be me. I’m taking steps to make sure of that.</p>

<p>At one time I viewed my web development skill as simply a means to an end – and only within the past few years has it been considered what philosophers would call “an end in itself”. I picked up this hammer to learn how to build. For a few years I joined the company of some of the best hammersmiths in the world. I even attended hammersmith conferences. But now I’m resting this hammer down for a little bit of a rest.</p>

		<h3 id="update-2252013"><strong>UPDATE 2/25/2013</strong></h3>

<p><strong>As of Facebook’s update last year, it appears that many of the old <a href="http://wiki.akosma.com/IPhone_URL_Schemes#Facebook">Facebook URL schemes</a> are no longer working…</strong>. So this post looks to be outdated and useless already. <img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<h3 id="the-skinny">The skinny</h3>

<p>Copy this code:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="tag">&lt;a</span> <span class="attribute-name">href</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">fb://publish/profile/me?text=foo</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span><span class="tag">&gt;</span>Post to Facebook<span class="tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>

<p>As you may know, Facebook has a URL scheme</p>

<pre><code>fb://
</code></pre>

<p>which seems to be mainly used by native developers. What most folks don’t realize is that it’s just a URL scheme, like http://, and that we can use it within our mobile browsers! The only problem is that there’s no official documentation for it, so folks have had to hunt down the particulars.</p>

<p>After poking around a bit, you might find <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5707722/what-are-all-the-custom-url-schemes-supported-by-the-facebook-iphone-app/">this topic on Stackoverflow</a>, which contains a ton of protocols for getting to specific sections of the Facebook app, as well as this interesting snippet:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="tag">&lt;a</span> <span class="attribute-name">href</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">fb://publish/profile/#ID#?text=#BODY#</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span><span class="tag">&gt;</span>fb://publish/profile/#ID#?text=#BODY#<span class="tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Trying that as a link does work, but it takes you to this blank screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/facebook-blank-screen.png" alt="Facebook app - blank screen" title="Facebook app - blank screen" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878" /></p>

<p>That blank screen isn’t too exciting, but it is peaceful, like a Zen rock garden. Bookmark that page so you can come back later, when you’re overwhelmed by friends flooding your updates screen with baby pictures.</p>

<h3 id="google-to-the-rescue">Google to the rescue!</h3>

<p>Ok, now back to work!</p>

<p>After poking around and trying to find my Facebook id, I inserted it and got the link to work. But that’s not ideal, since everyone has different user ids. And I’m not about to load in all the bloatware that comes with the Facebook API just to find a user id!</p>

<p>After poking around a bit, I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9077817/open-facebook-app-with-text-from-ipad-app">this link</a> which showed this generic pattern:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="tag">&lt;a</span> <span class="attribute-name">href</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">fb://publish/profile/me</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span><span class="tag">&gt;</span>fb://publish/profile/me<span class="tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Whoo! And that works! But I still want to prepopulate the status field. We can do that by passing in a URL parameter:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="tag">&lt;a</span> <span class="attribute-name">href</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">fb://publish/profile/me?text=foo</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span><span class="tag">&gt;</span>fb://publish/profile/me?text=foo<span class="tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Clicking on it will get you to a screen which looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/facebook-status-disabled.png" alt="Facebook status update with share button disabled" title="Facebook status update with share button disabled" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-865" /></p>

<p>This, interestingly enough, appears to be the old implementation of the status screen. Here’s what it looks like if you launch it through the button on the native app:</p>

<p><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/facebook-status-normal.png" alt="Facebook status - what it looks like normally" title="Facebook status - what it looks like normally" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867" /></p>

<p>Also note that the Share button is disabled until the user types in text themselves. This might be a little confusing for some users, but it’s probably the best way to prevent spam.</p>

<h3 id="detecting-if-the-facebook-app-is-installed">Detecting if the Facebook app is installed</h3>

<p>There’s another issue with <em>folks who don’t have the native Facebook app installed</em>. There doesn’t seem to be a perfect way to detect if the link failed and went nowhere. What we have to work with are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7231085/how-to-fall-back-to-marketplace-when-android-custom-url-scheme-not-handled">hacky workarounds involving setTimeout</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like native iOS apps have an ideal URL scheme checking ability with a <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/ios-sdk-working-with-url-schemes/">canOpenURL</a> method. Unfortunately it doesn’t look like the web has this function (yet). Let’s bug Apple to implement it! <img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>Just a heads up – I’m definitely not the first one to figure this out, as I found a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/ThinkingStiff/dpUKh/">jsfiddle</a> with the same information, plus an example for posting to Twitter. That was surprisingly the only result! I couldn’t find anyone who blogged about it yet, so here you are!</p>

		<p>(if you didn’t read the title – warning: rant…)</p>

<p>As far as web development goes, I guess I could rant on and on about the generalities. Of all things ephemeral. The lust after money, gadgets, and other worthless material crap that we use to stuff inside our oversized houses.</p>

<p>The startling creativity and in equal amounts the lack of creativity. The amount of amazing invention and the equal amount of copying and ripping off.</p>

<p>I could complain of amazing shortsightedness, of fads, and of constant new waves of developers that have to relearn and be convinced of old tried-and-true best practices (while still being able to identify the outdated best practices).</p>

<p>I could possibly ponder some of the stupid things we concern ourselves with, which are criticisms more aimed at the Silicon Valley mentality in general. The sheer amount of idiotic startups. The desire to have a startup only for the payout, for the acquisition. The one worthwhile and meaningful startup surrounded in a sea of hangers-ons, social network clones, photo sharing service clones, Facebook game clones, and on and on ad nauseum.</p>

<p>I could complain about the few passionate ones, surrounded by a pool of passionless jumpers-on-the-bandwagon, people looking for a free ride, and people looking to coast through their secure jobs, content with nothing more than receiving their paycheck.</p>

<p>I could complain about the lack of real heroes. People who made a difference to our small isolated communities, spoke at conferences, authored books, wrote popular blog articles, but were perhaps never themselves. People who we could not look up to as model human beings, but as model toolmakers and nothing more. I suppose it’s folly to look for too much else there anyhow.</p>

<p>I could complain about the praise of life imbalance. Of prideful people showing off, working longer hours than their peers, feeling like they have to in order to keep up, and bragging about losing sleep and becoming unbalanced and unhinged individuals. Competition is good and pushes everyone to be more detailed and more polished, but there seems to be no admission of a limit, of reaching a life imbalance. The more time spent coding, the better. If you don’t code in your free time, you must not be a true coder. If you don’t enjoy learning new languages, you must be a crappy coder. The amount of pride and self-delusion here is scary.</p>

<p>I could talk about corporations seeking young programmers without commitments in order to suck dry every last ounce of their passion, essence, and thirst, distracting their focus away from all things important. Of those same corporations sticking those young impressionables onto outdated projects, maintaining and fixing bugs. All for what?</p>

<p>I could speak of self-delusion that programming language X will save the world, and on self-delusion in general, which I believe is rampant here and elsewhere, and is possibly our greatest weakness as human beings.</p>

<p>I suppose now you’ll tell me I’ve lost my head and gone crazy, but I would disagree. These things have never been so clear and the arguments have never been so cogent as they are now. There is no utopia, no perfect occupation, but I believe there are some that are better than others. Everything has its faults, and web development isn’t for everyone. Perhaps it’s simply not for me?</p>

<p>I got into web development as a means to an end – as a way of publishing what I enjoyed doing. As a tool I picked up and put down when I was finished, and then got on with my life. Perhaps it’s time to move it back to that corner of my life, and even better, to use it as a tool to help me build new, meaningful, less ephemeral things. Something I could be proud of in more than a few years. Something more than being an “HTML5 expert” or “Mobile expert” or “JavaScript expert”.</p>

<p>No. I want to use these things as tools that are put back in their shed after I’m done. Tools to build something greater than the sum of its parts. Tools to make a meaningful contribution that may not amount to a hill a beans in this crazy world, but could at least be something I’m proud of.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession.</p>

  <p>People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.</p>

<h3 id="addendum">Addendum</h3>

<p>It’s notable to add that I’ve been comparing “Kyoto culture” to “Silicon Valley culture”. They are so dissimilar that it’s doubtful we’re even using “culture” in the same sense in both cases. Kyoto culture, a long proud, rich, colorful history of a people, and Silicon Valley culture: an atmosphere of tech, founded by money and driven by money. In one, it’s almost a crime to stay inside and not to explore and enjoy the city. In the other, our wealth lets us build up a castle, buy devices and home entertainment to keep us busy in our little fiefdom. Silicon Valley is more like a boomtown which exists only for one sick purpose, and consequentially lacks a soul even more severely. Would you rather be underpaid in a city with a soul or overpaid in a soulless city?</p>
