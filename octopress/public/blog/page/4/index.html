<p>In JavaScript, there’s many different ways of doing something. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. To the newcomer this is definitely a bad thing, as it means not only more things to learn, but more little caveats and more places to go wrong. And so it is with declaring functions!</p>

<p>The aim of this is just an accessible tour of the landscape, just so you know what’s out there and what the basic differences are. Do be sure to check out the “further reading” section as well! Much of this is based on <a href="http://kangax.github.com/nfe/">Juriy “kangax” Zaytsev’s article</a>, which goes into more depth. But I found that there wasn’t just one reference to show all the different variable declarations.</p>

<p>How about ways to execute functions? That opens up another can of worms, and incidentally opens up the possibility for a future post on that topic. <img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

</pre></td>

</div>

<h3 id="function-declarations-function-a">Function declarations: function A(){};</h3>

<p>Function declarations are probably the most familiar and oldest way of doing things in JavaScript land. This creates a variable A which is accessible in the current scope. Scope is a separate topic, so we’ll do everything in the global scope for all these examples (something you want to avoid usually).</p>

<h4 id="hoisting">1. Hoisting</h4>

<p>The interesting thing about these is that they are “hoisted” to the top of their scope, which means this code:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>A();
<span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">A</span>(){
  console.log(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">foo</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);
};
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Gets executed as this code:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">A</span>(){
  console.log(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">foo</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);
};
A();
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Which practically means that, yes, you can call the functions before they’re written in your code. It won’t matter, because the entire function gets hoisted to the top of its containing scope. (This is contrasted with variables, which only have their declaration hoisted, not their contents, as we’ll see in the next section).</p>

<h4 id="no-function-declarations-in-if-statements-or-loops-etch4">2. No function declarations in <code>if</code> statements (or loops, etc)&lt;/h4&gt;</h4>
<p>You can’t define functions this way in expressions, for example <code>if</code> statements, which is common if we want to define different versions of a function for different circumstances, usually to address browser inconsistencies. Well, you <em>can</em> in some implementations, but the way the code is processed is inconsistent (kangax has documented the inconsistencies <a href="http://kangax.github.com/nfe/">here</a>). If you want to use this pattern, use function expressions instead.</p>

<h4 id="functions-declarations-must-have-names">3. Functions declarations must have names</h4>

<p>This method doesn’t allow you to create anonymous functions, meaning that you always have to give it an identifier (in this case we’ve used “A”).</p>

<h3 id="function-expressions-var-b--function">Function expressions: var B = function(){};</h3>

<p>A function expression looks similar to function declarations, except that the function is assigned to a variable name. Though functions are not primitive values in JavaScript, this is the way they can be utilized to their full effect in this functional language. Functions are “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function">first class</a>“:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[JavaScript] supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="anonymous-functions-they-don8217t-need-names">1. Anonymous functions (they don’t need names)</h4>

<p>The function name is optional in function expressions, and we call these anonymous. Here we’re setting the variable B equal to an anonymous function:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">B</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<h4 id="variable-declaration-hoisting">2. Variable declaration hoisting</h4>

<p>Variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, somewhat similarly to function hoisting <em>except</em> the contents of the variable are not hoisted as well. This happens with all variables, and it means it’s now happening with our functions, now that we’re assigning them to variables.</p>

<p>This code:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">A</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">B</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">C</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Will be executed as this:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> A, B, C;  <span class="comment">// variable declarations are hoisted</span>
<span class="function">A</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};
<span class="function">B</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};
<span class="function">C</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Therefore the order of setting and calling this type of function is important:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
<a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a>
<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="comment">// this works</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">B</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};
B();

<span class="comment">// this doesn't work</span>
B2();  <span class="comment">// TypeError (B2 is undefined)</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">B2</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>The second example gives us an error because only the variable B2′s declaration is hoisted, but not its definition, thus the “undefined” error.</p>

<h3 id="function-expressions-with-grouping-operators-var-c--function">Function expressions with grouping operators: var C = (function(){});</h3>

<p>These really aren’t different from plain old function expressions and aren’t really seen in the wild (so maybe they’re just good for JavaScript quizzes?). Recently this way of declaring functions was brought up in <a href="http://ironjs.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/my-gripes-with-javascript/">this article</a> and confused some folks including myself.</p>

<p>Here’s a good way to see what’s happening:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">function</span>(){};  <span class="comment">// SyntaxError</span>
(<span class="keyword">function</span>(){});
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Why does one work and the other doesn’t? The first example is a function declaration, and we learned above that we can’t declare them anonymously – that is, they must have a name. That’s why we’re getting the syntax error.</p>

<p>The second example is using parenthesis – grouping operators – and is therefore evaluated differently, as a function expression. The grouping operators are the things we use to help show what should be evaluated first, as in mathematical problems. We’re saying “evaluate this first, then take the result and do something with it”:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>(<span class="integer">1</span> + <span class="integer">2</span>) * <span class="integer">3</span>;  <span class="comment">// 9</span>
<span class="integer">1</span> + (<span class="integer">2</span> * <span class="integer">3</span>);  <span class="comment">// 7</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>In the first example we’re saying “first add 1 and 2, then take the result and multiply by 3″, whereas in the second example we’re saying “first multiply 2 and 3, then take the result and add 1″.</p>

<p>Because functions are first class, we can use similar grouping operators. Here’s a facetious example, but it shows how we can essentially drop in a function in the same way:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">function</span>(){} + <span class="integer">1</span>);  <span class="comment">// function(){}1</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>The result is a string (because toString is being called on the function, then added/appended with 1), but you get the idea I hope.</p>

<p>When the JavaScript engine encounters the opening parenthesis here, we’re essentially saying “ok, start grouping this together with something else”. Using our technical terms, we’re telling the engine that we’re not making a function declaration, but instead a function expression. And then we can assign the result to a variable:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">function</span>(){});           <span class="comment">// resulting function not assigned</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> foo = (<span class="keyword">function</span>(){}); <span class="comment">// resulting function assigned to foo</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">bar</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){};   <span class="comment">// resulting function assigned to bar</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Here we can see that foo and bar are really just the same, because in foo we’re not grouping the function together with anything but itself.</p>

<h3 id="named-function-expression-var-d--function-foo">Named function expression: var D = function foo(){};</h3>

<p>Here we have our same old friend, the function expression. But instead of assigning the variable to an anonymous function, we’re assigning it to a named function (with the name foo).</p>

<h4 id="the-function-name-is-only-accessible-within-the-function">1. The function name is only accessible within the function</h4>

<p>We haven’t exposed the function name (foo) to the enclosing scope (in this case the global scope):</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">D</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">foo</span>(){
  console.log(<span class="keyword">typeof</span> foo);
};
D();                       <span class="comment">// function</span>
console.log(<span class="keyword">typeof</span> foo);   <span class="comment">// undefined</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<h4 id="useful-for-recursion">2. Useful for recursion</h4>

<p>Because the function’s name is accessible in the function itself, this turns out to be useful for recursive functions, much more useful than the plain old anonymous function.</p>

<p>Here’s a trivial recursive function to illustrate calling itself from within the named function expression:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
<a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a>
<a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a>
<a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">countdown</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function">a</span>(count){
  <span class="keyword">if</span>(count &gt; <span class="integer">0</span>) {
    count--;
    <span class="keyword">return</span> a(count);  <span class="comment">// we can also do this: a(--count), which is less clear</span>
  }
  console.log(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">end of recursive function</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);
}
countdown(<span class="integer">5</span>);
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<h4 id="useful-for-debugging">3. Useful for debugging</h4>

<p>As a <a href="http://kangax.github.com/nfe/">few</a> <a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/">have</a> pointed out, giving previously anonymous functions names helps in debugging, since the function name shows up on the call stack.</p>

<h4 id="quirks-jscript8217s-bad-implementation">4. Quirks: JScript’s bad implementation</h4>

<p><a href="http://kangax.github.com/nfe/">kangax</a> points out that named function expressions are basically poison to JScript, Internet Explorer’s implementation of JavaScript.</p>

<p>The named function becomes a global variable, is hoisted like a function declaration, and actually ends up creating multiple instances of the same function.</p>

<h3 id="immediately-invoked-function-expressions-iife-var-e--functionreturn-function">Immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFE): var E = (function(){return function(){}})();</h3>

<p>“Execute this function, whose return value is another function, and assign that to the variable E”. This may seem like magic, but it’s actually quite simple, and the pattern is powerful and has useful applications, the most famous of which is the <a href="http://www.klauskomenda.com/code/javascript-programming-patterns/#module">module pattern</a>.</p>

<p>First we’ll use an example that doesn’t look like magic:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">foo</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">bar</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>;
};
<span class="keyword">var</span> output = foo();
console.log(output);  <span class="comment">// 'bar'</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>We already learned about grouping operators above, so you should feel comfortable with saying this is equivalent:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">foo</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">bar</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>;
};
<span class="keyword">var</span> output = (foo)(); <span class="comment">// note the extra grouping operators</span>
console.log(output);  <span class="comment">// 'bar'</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Since foo is pointing to our function expression, we know that we can simply refrain from using the variable “foo” and drop in the entire function as an anonymous function (since functions are first class, after all!):</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> output = (<span class="keyword">function</span>(){
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">bar</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>;
})();
console.log(output);  <span class="comment">// 'bar'</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>Hey wait, we just arrived at the magical resulting function! It turns out to be not so magical after all, once we break it down and see it for what it is. It’s simply shorthand for the code we wrote originally, where we defined a function, executed it, and defined output to be its return value.</p>

<p>I’ve included this method on the list of declaring functions because we can assign the return value to itself be a function:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> E = (<span class="keyword">function</span>(){
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">function</span>(){}
})();
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<h4 id="applications">Applications</h4>

<p>There are good applications for this, including information hiding using in the module pattern, (<a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/partial-functions-in-javascript/">partial application</a>, for example), and other clever uses of it. It’s definitely not a trivial pattern.</p>

<h3 id="function-constructor-var-f--new-function">Function constructor: var F = new Function();</h3>

<p>This method is extremely old and it’s not recommended to be used. You pass in an unlimited number of arguments in the front, then the actual function body appears as a string in the last argument (because it’s a string, it’s effectively the equivalent of eval(), and isn’t recommended).</p>

<h4 id="defining-the-function">1. Defining the function</h4>

<p>You can create a function like this:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> F = <span class="keyword">new</span> Function(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">arg1</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">arg2</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">console.log(arg1 + &quot;, &quot; + arg2)</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);
F(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">foo</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">bar</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>);  <span class="comment">// 'foo, bar'</span>
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<h4 id="you-dont-need-the-new-operatorh4">2. You don’t need the <code>new</code> operator&lt;/h4&gt;</h4>
<p>You can simply write <code>var F = Function();</code> to get the same result.</p>

<h4 id="quirks">3. Quirks</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope#Function_constructor_vs._function_declaration_vs._function_expression">MDN docs</a> have some good examples of the quirks, including the fact that functions declared with the Function constructor don’t inherit their current scope properly (i.e. a closure isn’t formed).</p>

<p>What this means is that they don’t have access to variables in their enclosing scope, which isn’t particularly useful:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
<a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a>
<a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a>

</div>

<p>In the function “first”, we’re using the Function constructor, so it doesn’t have access to the variable bar. However, if we use the function “second”, which is a function expression, it does in fact have access to variables defined in its enclosing scope (via closure).</p>

<p>In other words, <em>don’t use the Function constructor</em>.</p>

<h3 id="special-case-8211-object-constructor-var-g--new-function-foo">Special case – object constructor: var G = new function foo(){};</h3>

<p>I saved this for last because we’re not really defining a function, though we are using the function keyword, so it’s worth noting at least.</p>

<p><code>new function(){};</code> creates a new object and invokes the anonymous function as its constructor. If an object is returned from the function, that becomes the resulting object, otherwise a new object is created from scratch and function is executed in the context of that new function (let’s save the details for another post!).</p>

<p>It’s a bit unusual to see it in this form. Let’s do it the proper way:</p>

<div><table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line-numbers"><pre><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a>
<a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a>
<a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a>
<a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a>
</pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="function">Person</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(){
  console.log(<span class="local-variable">this</span>);  <span class="comment">// Person</span>
}
<span class="keyword">var</span> joe = <span class="keyword">new</span> Person();
</pre></td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>So really with the new operator, we are giving it a new ‘this’ context and then executing the given function with that new context. Much different than the function definitions we’ve been dealing with above! This does into a whole new topic, and we’ll save that for later!</p>

		<p>Huge huge rant incoming, but all is not said and done, and much is open for debate of course. Counterpoints and criticisms are more than welcome in the comments. This is just my opinion based on my experience at this point in time.</p>

<h3 id="self-worth-the-rich-man-and-the-poor-man">Self-worth: the rich man and the poor man</h3>

<p>For a long while there have been places in the world that view self-worth as largely tied to wealth.  No doubt there is more than just money, as even within the rich community there’s a distinction between the established rich and the “nouveau riche”, or the newly rich.  One is ranked higher than the other, but nonetheless the rich are themselves seen as being more important than the average person.</p>

<p>You might not believe me.  That means it’s time for a thought experiment!</p>

<p>One way to hammer home this point is to posit a classic thought experiment.  There are two people – one rich and one poor – and this is all the information we have about them (this is important).  Assuming that one of them will die in some horrific way and we can only choose to save one, most people would probably save the rich person (assuming they don’t have a bias or some psychological complex against rich folks).  Remember, we have no other information about them other than one is rich and one is poor.  The aim of the thought experiment, rather than trying to give a realistic scenario, is to simply try to show us that we give the rich person preference.  At least ij the case where we have no other information.</p>

<p>And it’s not even that we think we might receive a reward from the rich person!  Even if we figure that in, we still give preference to the rich person, probably in part because we think that they must be somewhat more important than the poor person.  They must have acquired that money some way, after all.  Possobly even through hard work.  The poor person, we assume, must be poor for a reason, and that might be through sheer laziness.  So we have a hard worker versus a lazy worker… which one is more worthy to live?  And it’s only those hasty assumptions that we have to deal with.</p>

<h3 id="professional-worth-employees-of-famous-and-nonfamous-companies">Professional worth: employees of famous and nonfamous companies</h3>

<p>Laying aside issues of money for a moment, let’s perform a similar thought experiment, except with different people.  One person works at company X, which no one has really heard of, and the other person works at company Y, which at the time is a wildly famous and reputable company.  Because this industry is so fickle and subject to change, at the time of this writing this famous company might be Facebook, Google, or Twitter.  Or any other company which has the tech zeitgeist or mojo at the time.</p>

<p>Assuming we know nothing else but the people’s employers (and laying aside biases and hatred for certain companies), if we put these people on the line, the one employee of a no-name company and the other employee of a famous company, we would probably choose to save the latter.  For much of the same reasons as above.  For instance, this person got a job at Facebook, so they must be smart and a hard worker.  On the other hand, the person at the no-name company (i.e. the vast majority of people out there) is probably not as smart or not as hard-working.  After all, if they were, then they would’ve been at (famous company) by now!  Therefore they are undoubtedly less worthy professionally, and by hasty extension, less worthy as a human being (remember, we have no other information to base our conclusion off of).</p>

<p>So it is!  Death to the employee of the nonfamous company!</p>

<h3 id="work-history-first-impressions-and-professional-self-worth">Work history, first impressions, and professional self-worth</h3>

<p>We chose to save the rich person and the Facebook engineer. The good thing is that luckily almost no one thinks in these horrible black-and-white terms, and we always take into account other available factors.  For instance, as an example of a poor person we might have Mother Teresa and as a rich person we might have mean old Donald Trump.  No one in their right mind would send Mother Teresa off to the gallows while letting Trump off (regardless of what you think of Trump really).</p>

<p>The problem here is that although we do take into account different factors, professionally we (and recruiters) weigh our work history much too heavily in the grand scheme of things.  We take other factors into consideration, sure, but work history is a huge deciding factor as far as people are paid attention to, give off good first impressions, or are even given a single glance by recruiters.</p>

<p>This isn’t totally unwarranted, I should say.  Chances are, if someone worked at a few famous companies, there’s a good chance they are a better than average engineer, even though there’s no guarantee of this (there are always exceptions).  But that’s not the problem here.  The problem is because this is given a disproportionate amount of weight, people start to view this as THE deciding factor in whether to work for a company.  Name-brand recognition becomes a goal-in-itself.  Money always matters, sure, but professionally there is little that can beat having a reputable name brand on a resume.</p>

<p>So what happens in practice?  An engineer becomes employed at a famous big company, is put to work maintaining some existing platforms, and at the end of a year perhaps learns some things that make them a better engineer.  But the same person instead working for some no-name startup might in the same period of time learn many more technologies, solve many more problems, and have a bit more freedom and opportunity to create (though they won’t necessarily learn best practices or scaling issues that typically come with famous large companies, but there’s more to being a good engineer than that!).  Each gets an opportunity to get their hands dirty with different varieties of dirt.  At the end of the day, I would say the latter very well becomes a more well-rounded engineer, instead of a generic single-functioned cog in some big company machine.</p>

<p>Ok, now my bias is showing through brilliantly!</p>

<p>Let’s at least say, for the purposes of argument, that both engineers are equally skilled (though this is hard to quantify, though, obviously).  So who do the recruiters contact, the employee at the famous company or the employee at the nonfamous company?  Who gets more attention from people in general when they’re asked where they work?  In short, whose professional life is a priori more highly valued?  You already know the answer.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>

<p>We MUST become more confident of our skills (I need to work on this myself), and we must be tough enough and realistic enough to know our own professional worth.  Appearances count for much in this world, and too much at that.  But what better to maintain if we are authentic human beings: an appearance or something deeper?</p>

<p>Famous companies do look good on resumes in the same way Ivy Leagues colleges look good on the very same piece of paper.  But don’t make this a deciding factor when choosing an employer.  It’s true that it will help you find more jobs and get more respect in the long run, but then you are wasting your time doing something you don’t want to do for the duration, for a company that exists for its own ends, not the ends of its employees (this is true of most companies out there, to be fair).  If you are ok wasting your time for a cause such as this, then go for it. It seems some people are ok with that.  At the very least be aware of it.</p>

<p>So what happens to the passionate engineers who actually do want to work for a famous company for reasons other than brand recognition?  They might not always get the job.  But it’s definitely not the end of the world.  No one should be disheartened because Google turned them away for not being able to answer today’s technological equivalent of “how many angels can dance on the head of a pin” (or other mental masturbation puzzles).  In the end it’s you that makes you a worthy professional and a good engineer.  If your job doesn’t actually give you a chance to be one, you can still become one on your own.  I would say most people are capable of this if they invest the effort.</p>

<p>But working for a famous company, and for its own sake?  It doesn’t necessarily make you a good engineer, any more than wearing glasses and dressing in a suit gives more validity to your opinions (even though many people sadly tend to think otherwise).</p>

<p>(Note to self: I wrote this on the banks of the Kamogawa River in Kyoto on my iPad. I was enjoying the moment and obviously in a contemplative mood!)</p>

		<p>(note: this is based on the first iOS5 beta [9A5220p] and is subject to change on final release)</p>

<p>It looks like there’s finally some major improvements in mobile Safari, some of which I’ve found below on my “first glance” after downloading the SDK. Chime in if you find anything yourself!</p>

<h3 id="bad-news-first">Bad news first</h3>

<p>Much to my disappointment, browser-based file uploads are still not supported (<a href="http://frontendstuff.com/html/examples/input-type-file.html">input type=”file”</a>), even though they have been supported on Android since version 2.2 (which they have <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/android-3-0-honeycomb-is-first-to-implement-the-device-api">continued to improve and refine</a>). The best use case for this is uploading pictures and videos straight from the browser, but Apple seems more interested in making those functions possible directly from the operating system itself, supporting only big names like Twitter and YouTube. So much for the little guys.</p>

<p>There’s other stuff on my wishlist that hasn’t yet been implemented, such as <s>WebGL and</s> indexedDB, along with some HTML5 input types, but regardless it’s good to see some real progress in iOS 5. (update: it appears that some WebGL features are starting to be supported, although the demos I tried didn’t seem to work).</p>

<p>Now let’s move on to the awesome new stuff that IS implemented!</p>

<h3 id="positionfixed">position:fixed</h3>

<p>A point of contention since the original iPhone was released in 2007, position:fixed now works on iOS5! What this means to developers: it’s now very easy to create top and bottom toolbars for your web apps. (there’s a long history of hacks and workarounds which will still need to be implemented as a fallback for the time being, but I’ll save that for another post. I should also mention that position:fixed has worked on Android since version 2.2, and webOS seems to support a somewhat hacky implementation).</p>

<p>Here’s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFzv3ETwfms">video demo of position:fixed on iOS5</a>:</p>

<p>(check out the <a href="http://frontendstuff.com/css/examples/position-fixed.html">demo</a> for yourself)</p>

<h3 id="overflowscroll">overflow:scroll</h3>

<p>This is a similar problem to position:fixed, but now it works on iOS5! For content that doesn’t fit in its container element, previously the content was completely cut off (similarly with iframes). On the desktop we have the option to show scrollbars instead, allowing the user to scroll to see the content, but iOS made this difficult by requiring two fingers to scroll. Now overflow:scroll works and the user can scroll through the container’s content with a single finger. Developers can use new CSS to enable native scrolling (with scrollbars and momentum):</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>(via <a href="http://johanbrook.com/browsers/native-momentum-scrolling-ios-5/">Johan Brook</a>).</p>

<p>It’s assumed that it’s up to the developer to implement some sort of visual indicator to let the user know they can interact with the element.</p>

<p>One criticism so far: there’s no inertia scroll on this element, so it doesn’t quite feel the same as scrolling the page.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwpZ1F6dW5U">video demo of overflow:scroll on iOS 5</a>.</p>

<p>(check out the <a href="http://frontendstuff.com/css/examples/overflow-scroll.html">demo</a> for yourself)</p>

<h3 id="new-input-types">New Input Types</h3>

<p>HTML5 defined many new helpful input types, and mobile operating systems have been slowly implementing them and creating optimized keyboards for the inputs. iOS5 now supports these input types: date, datetime, month, time, range. Click on the images to see their respective demo pages:</p>

<p><a href="http://frontendstuff.com/html/input-type-date.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ios-date-input.png" alt="iOS Date Input" title="iOS Date Input" width="320" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-677" /></a><a href="http://frontendstuff.com/html/input-type-datetime.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ios-datetime-input.png" alt="iOS Datetime Input" title="iOS Datetime Input" width="320" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-678" /></a><a href="http://frontendstuff.com/html/input-type-month.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ios-month-input.png" alt="iOS Month Input" title="iOS Month Input" width="320" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-680" /></a><a href="http://frontendstuff.com/html/input-type-time.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ios-time-input.png" alt="iOS Time Input" title="iOS Time Input" width="320" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-682" /></a><a href="http://frontendstuff.com/html/input-type-range.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ios-range-input.png" alt="iOS Range Input" title="iOS Range Input" width="320" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-681" /></a></p>

<p>And a fun one – <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/implementing-iphone-slider-unlock-with-input-type-range">my iPhone slider hack based on input type range</a>, which now actually works on the iPhone itself (because input type=”range” is now supported)!</p>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/iphone-slider.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ios-iphone-slider-in-html.png" alt="iOS Slider implemented with Range Input" title="iOS Slider implemented with Range Input" width="320" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-679" /></a></p>

<h3 id="web-workers-javascript">Web Workers (JavaScript)</h3>

<p>JavaScript is single-threaded, and it happens to run on the same thread as the UI, which means computationally expensive operations can lead to an unresponsive UI, and no one likes that. Web Workers help by offloading tasks to another thread and only returning output when it needs to. In other words, it’s a good thing for us web developers.</p>

<p>According to my own tests, Web Workers seemed to be briefly enabled on early versions of iOS3, but were soon disabled thereafter. Now with iOS5, they’re back again!</p>

		<p>(why does Twitter make it so hard? What did RSS ever do to it?)</p>

<h3 id="the-skinny">The skinny</h3>

<p>The Twitter API appears to support two methods for getting RSS feeds of lists. Both of these methods are pretty buried and their API docs don’t help too much, but nonetheless both of these feeds work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://api.twitter.com/1/nathansmith/lists/javascript/statuses.atom">http://api.twitter.com/1/nathansmith/lists/javascript/statuses.atom</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have the list ID (requires using some dev tools – see below), you can also use this format:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://api.twitter.com/1/lists/statuses.atom?list_id=41981352">http://api.twitter.com/1/lists/statuses.atom?list_id=41981352</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-explanation">The explanation</h3>

<p>As it turns out, getting an RSS feed of a Twitter list is no easy task, at least from what I’ve found. Twitter has largely replaced RSS for me, in terms of getting the latest and greatest information, and maybe Twitter wants to keep it that way by having me rely on their service instead of an RSS feed. That’s how it seems to me anyway (this is also evidenced by their <a href="https://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/111-features/articles/15361-how-to-find-your-rss-feed">killing off of making RSS feeds easily discoverable</a> but still making the feed available as long as you can figure out your Twitter user id (which is a task in itself), for instance here’s my RSS feed: <a href="https://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/16521889.rss">https://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/16521889.rss</a>). I’d say this is simply a conspiracy against RSS feeds and developers in general, which is the direction Twitter is headed these days.</p>

<p>In any case, I digress! I want to get an RSS feed of a Twitter list. Great! All I should have to do is go to the page of the list and subscribe to the RSS feed. But.. there’s no RSS feed. Hmm.</p>

<h3 id="google-is-your-friend8230-most-of-the-time">Google is your friend… most of the time</h3>

<p>A search for “twitter list rss” comes up with links to implementing an RSS feed via Yahoo Pipes as well as pages referring to an appspot service that now 404s (<a href="http://twiterlist2rss.appspot.com/">twiterlist2rss</a>). In any case, they are both not what I’m looking for. Which means I have to get creative. Which means… my options at this point are screen scraping (made harder by the fact that Twitter content is now served with JavaScript) or.. gasp.. using their API!</p>

<h3 id="twitter-rest-api-to-the-rescue">Twitter REST API to the rescue</h3>

<p>After digging through the API docs, I found just the page I was looking for, <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/lists/statuses">detailing the REST service for Twitter lists</a>.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the basic structure for requesting list data is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://api.twitter.com/version/lists/statuses.format</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a newbie Twitter developer, there were a couple of things wrong here. First, what’s the version of the API I’m supposed to use? From other examples on the web (outside of the documentation…) I just assumed I’d be using version 1, and that seemed to work. Ok, whatever, we’ll go with 1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://api.twitter.com/1/lists/statuses.format</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second step: this API is actually quite nice, and will return data in three different formats: xml, json, or atom (RSS!). Ok, now we’re making progress!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://api.twitter.com/1/lists/statuses.atom</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="where8217s-this-listid-you-speak-of">Where’s this list_id you speak of?</h3>

<p>Now to pass in the info – I need to pass in the list ID in a key called “list_id”. The only problem is… where do I find the list ID? For the purposes of this example I’ll use <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nathansmith/javascript">Nathan Smith’s excellent JavaScript developers list</a>. To normal human beings, this list might be called “nathansmith/javascript”, but a Twitter ID is numerical, so that’s not what we’re looking for.</p>

<p>So.. I assume at this point I can use some of the Twitter developer tools and fiddle around with them until I find an API call that will translate the human-readable list name into a numerical ID. But no.. I don’t want to download anything, I don’t want to investigate more of the API or go down any more rabbit holes.</p>

<p>It’s time to cut this rabbit hole short and do a bit of investigating. So I pulled up the list, opened up Web Inspector in Chrome, and took a look at the Network tab in the hopes of seeing an API call with an ID I was looking for…</p>

<p>…And I found it! Somewhere down the line, Twitter was calling statuses.json with this request:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>https://api.twitter.com/1/lists/statuses.json?list_id=41981352&#038;include_entities=1&#038;include_available_features=1&#038;contributor_details=true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s our list_id (and incidentally, the same API call [with json instead of atom].. which shows that Web Inspector is more useful than API docs sometimes)! After a short copy-paste, all the pieces of my Frankenstein API call have been put together:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://api.twitter.com/1/lists/statuses.atom?list_id=41981352">http://api.twitter.com/1/lists/statuses.atom?list_id=41981352</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it works, without having to mess around with OAuth or authentication, registering an app, or whatever. Of course now we can refer back to the API docs and mess around with some parameters to get just the data I’m looking for. Maybe most useful to developers is the handy ability to get easily paginated results:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://api.twitter.com/1/lists/statuses.atom?list_id=41981352&#038;page=2">http://api.twitter.com/1/lists/statuses.atom?list_id=41981352&#038;page=2</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s also what would be a handy “count” variable, but it’s altogether useless as it appears to be ignored. The API always returned 20 results for me.</p>

<p>In any case, there you have it! The incredibly roundabout way to get an RSS feed of your favorite Twitter list.</p>

<h3 id="update"><strong>UPDATE</strong></h3>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://sociable.co/2011/05/05/as-twitter-protects-its-ecosystem-heres-how-to-create-an-rss-feed-of-a-twitter-list/">this site</a>, it looks like there’s a more straightforward way of getting the RSS feed. Using the same list we were trying to get above, it looks like this also works:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://api.twitter.com/1/nathansmith/lists/javascript/statuses.atom</p>

		<p>(OR “The Post In Which I Conflate Programming and Philosophy” OR “The Programmer’s Existentialist Crisis”)</p>

<p>I woke up this morning to read Dmitry A. Soshnikov’s tweet:<br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/DmitrySoshnikov/status/39356492058607616"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/two-programming-languages.png" alt="Have one-two langs in which you are a master and know professionally, and in addition, consider alternative langs. Your experience will grow." width="661" height="318" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-639" /></a></p>

<p>While this seems like good advice for aspiring programmers, I can’t help but think what this means for those who will buy into this. Us programmers have a keen ability to sit and focus on problems for extended periods of time, usually to the detriment of everything else around us. From the perspective of “real life”, we might as well be sitting in a basement somewhere playing World of Warcraft. Sure, programming is more productive, profitable, and surely not brainless, but at the end of the day we could still only be sitting in a basement somewhere. What I mean to say here is that we’re not actually living our actual lives doing these things.</p>

<p>I realize Dmitry was only talking about learning another programming language for professional life, but for me and so many others, professional life is not easily separated from personal life. We don’t just work during the week during work hours. We can’t just turn off our minds and stop thinking about it when we go home. I end up thinking about programming or web design puzzles in my leisure time and on weekends, largely <em>because I enjoy doing so</em>. But when I see something questioning whether I should be devoting even more of this time to learning another programming language, I think about what I could be doing instead. Put another way, I think about what is missing and neglected in my life, and how those things will remain missing and neglected.</p>

<p>Socrates famously said <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Socrates#Apology">“The unexamined life is not worth living”</a>. He, along with those who followed in his immediate footsteps (famously, Plato and Aristotle) were concerned with how us mere mortals should live our lives, and more particularly how we should lead <em>good</em> lives. The sad fact about (western) philosophy is that it’s turned into a shadow of its former self, now plagued by millennia of self-doubt and failed grandiose systems. But it seems the original Socratic intention of finding how to lead a <em>good</em> life is still an admirable goal, even if we disagree on how exactly to achieve it.</p>

<p>Socrates also had a bit to say about those seeking to be experts in their field, and he couldn’t resist getting in a jab at his wife in the process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the example of the rider who wishes to become an expert horseman: “None of your soft-mouthed, docile animals for me,” he says; “the horse for me to own must show some spirit” in the belief, no doubt, if he can manage such an animal, it will be easy enough to deal with every other horse besides. And that is just my case. I wish to deal with human beings, to associate with man in general; hence my choice of wife. I know full well, if I can tolerate her spirit, I can with ease attach myself to every human being else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, Socrates essentially just compared his wife with a horse. A wild horse, to be exact.</p>

<p>I’m unsure if this translates well into learning programming languages. Does this mean we should learn the worst languages first, so that the rest of the languages we learn will be comparably easy? I hope not, that seems like quite a lot of wasted time. But I certainly agree that <em>the first languages we learn shouldn’t be the easiest</em>. This might only make us frustrated in the long run. So perhaps we can learn something from Socrates’s quote after all, if taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>So should we still strive to become experts in our field? I believe that’s an admirable and acceptable goal, but it shouldn’t be our main goal. We should first be concerned with leading good lives. I myself have a LONG way to go on this point, believe me.</p>

<p>I’ll surely learn another programming language, but not for its own sake, unless my life is in reasonably good order.</p>

		<p>In general it’s a good practice to check for the existence of something before blindly using it by faith and hoping it works. There are various times during the execution of scripts when a variable may not be defined, it may be null, or it might be an empty string. These are three things that are easily conflated. A good way to look at this is thinking of these as having increasing levels of existence (getting a bit philosophical here for a moment…):</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">foo0;             // existence level 0 (creates the error "not defined")
var foo1;         // existence level 1 ("undefined" - variable declared but not defined/initialized)
var foo2 = null;  // existence level 2 (variable initialized, but isn't an Object, Number, String, etc)
var foo3 = "";    // existence level 3 (variable initialized to an empty String)
var foo4 = "bar"; // existence level 4 (variable initialized to String "foo")
</pre>

<p>Generally it would be handy if we had some way to filter out everything but the very last line. We simply want to check for these cases without the script entirely blowing up, as it does with the first line:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">foo;  // ReferenceError: foo is not defined
</pre>

<p>We’re not particularly doing anything useful with foo here, but notice that the script fails out anyway. At this point any code that follows will not be executed. Your first instinct might be “Oh! I know how to contain these errors! We’ll use a try-catch!”:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">try {
  foo;
} catch(e) {
  e.message;  // "foo is not defined"
}
</pre>

<p>The script still fails, but not critically, so your script continues to execute. But this turns out to aversely affect performance. The basic lesson here is that try-catch can be useful in some situations, but shouldn’t be used where alternatives are available.</p>

<h3 id="typeof-foo">typeof foo</h3>

<p>JavaScript has quite a useful remedy for this:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">typeof foo; // "undefined"
</pre>

<p>Unlike everything else in JavaScript, typeof will deal with whatever you throw at it, including undefined variables. So you can use it as a simple check before using a variable that might not exist:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">if(typeof foo !== "undefined") {
  // do something with foo
}
</pre>

<p>Note that this is easy to confuse with the</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          undefined
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>keyword, which in this case doesn’t help us one bit, as it gives us a fatal error:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">if(foo !== undefined) {  // ReferenceError: foo is not defined

}
</pre>

<p>This filters out our first two cases, since they both evaluate to “undefined”:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">typeof foo; // "undefined"

var bar;
typeof bar; // "undefined"
</pre>

<p>But this turns out not to work well for our other conditions, which evaluate differently:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">typeof null;  // "object" (what?!)
typeof "";    // "string"
</pre>

<p>So we need to add other “if” conditions to check.. but there turns out to be a better way!</p>

<h3 id="exploiting-loose-typing">Exploiting loose typing</h3>

<p>JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means that it will “automagically” cast variables into other types when necessary (i.e. when adding a Number to a String), sometimes resulting in the unexpected. For instance, whenever we use the “if” statement, the expected input is a Boolean true/false value. If JavaScript gets anything other than a Boolean, such as a String or a Number, instead of blowing up completely (as in strictly typed languages such as C), it’ll cast the variable into a Boolean for you.</p>

<p>“How handy!” you might think. Except in the following unexpected cases:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">if("0") {
  // this will run because "0" is true
}

if("false") {
  // this will run because "false" is true
}
</pre>

<p>To see what JavaScript will cast a value to without having to use an</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          if
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>statement, we could create a new Boolean value with the following:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">Boolean(0);    // false
Boolean("0");  // true
</pre>

<p>Or we can use the less intuitive but quick way of using double exclamation marks (this will probably award you cleverness points in someone’s book.. hopefully those points actually matter):</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">!!0;    // false
!!"0";  // true
</pre>

<p>This works because !foo converts foo to a Boolean but negates its original value, turning it on its head. !!foo converts foo to a Boolean and flips it back to its expected value, which is the same value that’s evaluated by our</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          if
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>statement.</p>

<p>Using this ALMOST gives us the answer we’re looking for:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">!!foo0; // ReferenceError: foo0 is not defined

var foo1;
!!foo1; // false

var foo2 = null;
!!foo2; // false (same as !!null)

var foo3 = "";
!!foo3; // false (same as !!"")

var foo4 = "bar";
!!foot4; // true (same as !!"bar")
</pre>

<p>Excluding the first example, now we can test for uninitialized variables (foo1), null variables (foo2), and empty strings (foo3) all with just an</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          if
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>statement:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">if(foo1) {
  // do something with foo1
}

if(foo2) {
  // do something with foo2
}

if(foo3) {
  // do something with foo3
}
</pre>

<p>Dang… so close! But we can’t yet test the first case without an error:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">if(foo0) {  // ReferenceError: foo0 is not defined

}
</pre>

<h3 id="foo-versus-windowfoo-and-thisfoo">foo versus window.foo and this.foo</h3>

<p>The secret to our solution lies in how JavaScript handles undefined variables versus undefined properties. Here’s a quick reminder on the difference between the two:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">// variable foo
var foo;

// property bar (and object variable foo)
var foo = {};  // create an empty object to add bar too
foo.bar = "";
</pre>

<p>The difference between these makes all the difference whether a fatal error occurs:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">foo;  // ReferenceError: foo is not defined

var foo = {};
foo.bar;  // undefined
foo.blah; // undefined
</pre>

<p>We can randomly invent and check any property of</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          foo
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>we want, and the code will keep chugging along:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">var foo = {};
foo.something = "hello";

if(foo.bar) { // undefined, interpreted as false (same as !!foo.bar)
  // never runs
}

if(foo.something) {
  foo.something;  // "hello"
}
</pre>

<p>Now comes the magic. If you know anything about JavaScript running in the browser, you know that all global variables are part of the</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          window
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>object. This means</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          foo
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          window.foo
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>are equivalent:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">var foo;

foo === window.foo;  // true

// "this" is another bag of worms, but note this anyway
this.foo === window.foo;
</pre>

<p>So technically our variable foo is a <em>property</em> of the window object. So we should be able to check for any arbitrary variable in the window scope now!</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">window.foo;  // undefined (not a fatal error!)

// even though we're checking for the same thing, we get a fatal error…
foo;  // ReferenceError: foo is not defined
</pre>

<h3 id="practical-uses">Practical uses</h3>

<p>Now as long as we have a global entry point for our code, we can write our code in such a way that it won’t ever give us a fatal error if our variables aren’t yet defined:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">if(window.foo &#038;&#038; foo.bar) {
  foo.bar();
}
</pre>

<p>Of course nothing happens, because we haven’t defined foo. But why doesn’t foo.bar give us a fatal error? Because the first test,</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          window.foo
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>failed out. It would be useless processing for the JavaScript engine to also evaluate the second statement, because the end result will still be the same (false &#038;&#038; true results in false, false &#038;&#038; false results in false). So it doesn’t get so far as</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          foo.bar
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>.</p>

<p>And now the code will work properly when we hook up our code to our</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          foo
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>global namespace:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">var foo = {
  bar: function() {
    alert("hello world");
  }
}

if(window.foo &#038;&#038; foo.bar) {
  foo.bar();  // "hello world"
}
</pre>

<h3 id="shorthand">Shorthand</h3>

<p>It’s becoming common to see an abbreviation for the above code. Check out the following two methods, which accomplish the same thing:</p>

<pre name="code" class="JScript">// Method 1
if(window.foo &#038;&#038; foo.bar) {
  foo.bar();  // "hello world"
}

// Method 2
window.foo &#038;&#038; foo.bar &#038;&#038; (foo.bar());
</pre>

<p>Don’t get too scared.. these blocks of code are equivalent. Method 2 is shorter, but it simply goes something like this: if window.foo isn’t set, stop evaluating this line (just as above in the</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text twitlight" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:435px;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          if
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>statement). Otherwise, if foo.bar exists then execute the code in parentheses, which gives us an alert (“hello world”);</p>

<p>Just a word of caution about using Method 2: it’s obviously less clear what’s going on here. Your own cleverness might actually result in unnecessary confusion, especially of other people work in the same code base and they’re at different levels of understanding. In these cases we should first strive to be clear, and then only clever if it’s not at the expense of being clear.</p>

<p>It’s also likely that a code minifier would take care of this cleverness for us at build time, giving us the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>This is just a fun little <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW2IXHBPOIo">video demo</a> into the inner workings of today’s Google Doodle. Nothing you can’t do yourself with Firebug or Web Inspector (built into WebKit browsers such as Safari and Chrome). But I liked this doodle so much, I wanted to talk about it!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I know the difference between HTML5 and CSS3, but I’m not much one for pedantic nomenclature (however, I am apparently supportive of pedantic words like nomenclature). For the purposes of this video, webkit transforms and transitions are part of HTML5.</p>

<p>EDIT: Apparently I missed that the doodle has accelerometer support for devices that support it! Confirmed that it works on my MacBook Pro in Chrome.</p>
