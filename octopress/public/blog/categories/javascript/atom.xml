    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="first-steps-with-for-loops">First steps with <code>for</code> loops</h2>
<p>Most folks find <code>for</code> loops powerful enough to achieve all they need when they need to process items in an <code>Array</code>.  For example, say we have a simple list of items:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const beatles = [
	'John Lennon',
	'Paul McCartney',
	'George Harrison',
	'Ringo Starr'
];
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s say that we want to display all these names in a Markdown list, which means we simply need to prefix each item with an asterisk and a space, e.g. <code>* John Lennon</code>.</p>

<p>Ok!  Seems easy enough.  Let’s see how we’d do this with a loop:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const beatles = [
	'John Lennon',
	'Paul McCartney',
	'George Harrison',
	'Ringo Starr'
];

let beatlesMarkdown = [];
for (let index = 0; index &lt; beatles.length; index++) {
	beatlesMarkdown.push(`* ${ beatles[index] }`);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here’s the resulting array, which we’ve put into <code>beatlesMarkdown</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">[
	'* John Lennon',
	'* Paul McCartney',
	'* George Harrison',
	'* Ringo Starr'
]
</code></pre>

<p>(note the extra line break at the end, which isn’t too big of a deal in this case, but could be annoying for other use cases)</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/async.parallel-with-a-simple-timeout-node-js/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-08T00:36:52-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/async.parallel-with-a-simple-timeout-node-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back I had a need for a general timeout option for async.parallel and was surprised I couldn’t find much information about how to do it.  I was using async.parallel to make a lot of REST calls in parallel, but one of them was getting blocked by a firewall, resulting in an eventual timeout minutes later.</p>

<p>One option was to specify a shorter timeout for each individual REST call, including the one causing the problem.  But I wanted a simpler solution: a general timeout for that specific async.parallel instance that made it clear all tasks should finish within a certain period of time. Otherwise return a timeout as an error, allowing the program to continue (and retry if necessary).</p>

<p>It was somewhat surprising there wasn’t an option built into async.parallel, as I could imagine other folks must have had the same problem at some point in time.</p>

<p>In any case, I wrote a pretty simple wrapper function that gets the job done (see example usage below):</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">	var async = require('async');

	// async.parallel with optional timeout (options.timeoutMS)
	function parallel(options, tasks, cb) {
		//  sanity checks
		options = options || {};

		// no timeout wrapper; passthrough to async.parallel
		if(typeof options.timeoutMS != 'number') return async.parallel(tasks, cb);

		var timeout = setTimeout(function(){
			// remove timeout, so we'll know we already erred out
			timeout = null;

			// error out
			cb('async.parallel timed out out after ' + options.timeoutMS + 'ms.', null);
		}, options.timeoutMS);

		async.parallel(tasks, function(err, result){
			// after all tasks are complete

			// noop if timeout was called and annulled
			if(!timeout) return;

			// cancel timeout (if timeout was set longer, and all parallel tasks finished sooner)
			clearTimeout(timeout);

			// passthrough the data to the cb
			cb(err, result);
		});
	}


	// example usage
	parallel({timeoutMS: 10000}, [  // 10 second timeout
		function(){ ... },
		function(){ ... }
	],
	function(err, results) {
		if(err) {
			// timeouts can now be handled here
		}
	});


	// an example forcing a timeout to occur
	parallel({
		timeoutMS: 1000   // 1 second timeout
	},
	[
		function(done){
			// task 1 completes in 100ms
			setTimeout(function(){
				done(null, 'foo');
			}, 100);
		},
		function(done){
			// task 2 completes in 2000ms, forcing a timeout error
			setTimeout(function(){
				done(null, 'bar');
			}, 2000);
		}
	],
	function(err, results) {
		// err = 'async.parallel timed out out after 1000ms.'
	});

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-30T11:59:21-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Over the years there’s been a steadily increasing ecosystem of JavaScript components to choose from.  The sheer amount of choices is fantastic, but this also infamously presents a difficulty when components are mixed-and-matched.  And it doesn’t take too long for budding developers to find out that not all components are built to play nicely together.</p>

<p>To address these issues, the competing module specs AMD and CommonJS have appeared on the scene, allowing developers to write their code in an agreed-upon sandboxed and modularized way, so as not to “pollute the ecosystem”.</p>

<h2 id="amd">AMD</h2>
<p>Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) has gained traction on the frontend, with RequireJS being the most popular implementation.</p>

<p>Here’s module <code>foo</code> with a single dependency on <code>jquery</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">    //    filename: foo.js
    define(['jquery'], function ($) {
        //    methods
        function myFunc(){};

        //    exposed public methods
        return myFunc;
    });
</code></pre>

<p>And a little more complicated example with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">    //    filename: foo.js
    define(['jquery', 'underscore'], function ($, _) {
        //    methods
        function a(){};    //    private because it's not returned (see below)
        function b(){};    //    public because it's returned
        function c(){};    //    public because it's returned

        //    exposed public methods
        return {
            b: b,
            c: c
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of the define is an array of dependencies, while the second part is essentially the callback function which is only executed when the dependencies are available (script loaders like RequireJS take care of that part, including figuring out where the files are located).</p>

<p>Note that the dependency to variable order is important (ex. jquery-&gt;<code>$</code>, underscore-&gt;<code>_</code>).</p>

<p>Also note that we can map the dependencies to any arbitrary variables we want here.  If we change <code>$</code> to <code>$$</code> in the code above, all jQuery references within our function block will be <code>$$</code> instead of <code>$</code>.</p>

<p>And note, most importantly, that you can’t reference the variables <code>$</code> and <code>_</code> outside of the function, because it’s sandboxed from other code.  That’s the goal here!</p>

<h2 id="commonjs">CommonJS</h2>

<p>CommonJS is a style you may be familiar with if you’re written anything in Node (which uses a slight variant).  It’s also been gaining traction on the frontend with Browserify.</p>

<p>Using the same format as before, here’s what our <code>foo</code> module looks like in CommonJS:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">    //    filename: foo.js

    //    dependencies
    var $ = require('jquery');

    //    methods
    function myFunc(){};

    //    exposed public method (single)
    module.exports = myFunc;
</code></pre>

<p>And our more complicate example, with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">    //    filename: foo.js
    var $ = require('jquery');
    var _ = require('underscore');

    //    methods
    function a(){};    //    private because it's omitted from module.exports (see below)
    function b(){};    //    public because it's defined in module.exports
    function c(){};    //    public because it's defined in module.exports

    //    exposed public methods
    module.exports = {
        b: b,
        c: c
    };
</code></pre>

<h2 id="umd-universal-module-definition">UMD: Universal Module Definition</h2>

<p>Since CommonJS and AMD styles have both been equally popular, it seems there’s yet no consensus.  This has brought about the push for a “universal” pattern that supports both styles, which brings us to none other than the Universal Module Definition.</p>

<p>The pattern is admittedly ugly, but is both AMD and CommonJS compatible, as well as supporting the old-style “global” variable definition:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">    (function (root, factory) {
        if (typeof define === 'function' &amp;&amp; define.amd) {
            // AMD
            define(['jquery'], factory);
        } else if (typeof exports === 'object') {
            // Node, CommonJS-like
            module.exports = factory(require('jquery'));
        } else {
            // Browser globals (root is window)
            root.returnExports = factory(root.jQuery);
        }
    }(this, function ($) {
        //    methods
        function myFunc(){};

        //    exposed public method
        return myFunc;
    }));
</code></pre>

<p>And keeping in the same pattern as the above examples, the more complicated case with multiple dependencies and multiple exposed methods:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">    (function (root, factory) {
        if (typeof define === 'function' &amp;&amp; define.amd) {
            // AMD
            define(['jquery', 'underscore'], factory);
        } else if (typeof exports === 'object') {
            // Node, CommonJS-like
            module.exports = factory(require('jquery'), require('underscore'));
        } else {
            // Browser globals (root is window)
            root.returnExports = factory(root.jQuery, root._);
        }
    }(this, function ($, _) {
        //    methods
        function a(){};    //    private because it's not returned (see below)
        function b(){};    //    public because it's returned
        function c(){};    //    public because it's returned

        //    exposed public methods
        return {
            b: b,
            c: c
        }
    }));
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/a/negative-scroll-blur.html">Demo</a></p>

<p>Just for fun, I wanted to reproduce a cool but completely superfluous UI I saw in the updated Foursquare app recently. Basically, when the user tries to scroll past the upper bound of the app/page, the header image becomes blurred.</p>

<p>We can do the same thing on the web by listening for negative scroll and then using (abusing?) CSS filters.</p>

<h3 id="extra-tweaks-for-mobile">Extra tweaks for mobile</h3>

<p>Note that there’s an extra trick for iOS, which presents problems I had forgotten about (namely, no negative scroll, and a scroll listener which fires once at the end of scrolling). That’s why I had to throw in some extra logic for touchstart/touchmove/touchend.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/you-cant-javascript-under-pressure-walkthrough</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend posted a link to this fun little quiz - <a href="http://toys.usvsth3m.com/javascript-under-pressure/">You Can’t JavaScript Under Pressure</a>.</p>

<p>The quizzes get more and more difficult, and they present a nice challenge if you fear your skills are getting rusty. Give it an honest try first, then come back here if you get seriously, honestly stuck. Try to do it yourself!</p>

<h3 id="quiz-1-doubleinteger">Quiz 1: doubleInteger</h3>

<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function doubleInteger(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Double it and return it.

    return i;
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function doubleInteger(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Double it and return it.
    
    return i * 2;
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>

<p>Nothing tricky going on here. The prompt implies this should be done in two steps, but a one-liner works. We know i will always be an integer, so we don’t need any sanitization checks, just a straight up return.</p>

<h3 id="quiz-2-isnumbereven">Quiz 2: isNumberEven</h3>

<h4 id="problem-1">Problem</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function isNumberEven(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Return true if it’s even, and false if it isn’t.
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="solution-1">Solution</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function isNumberEven(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Return true if it’s even, and false if it isn’t.
    
    if(i % 2 === ) {
        //  no remainder, so it must be an even number
        return true;
    } else {
        //  remainder, so it must be odd.
        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="explanation-1">Explanation</h4>

<p>Again, no sanitization needed here because i is guaranteed to be an integer. The solution relies on an understanding of the modulus function - this is something usually learned in school, but something I haven’t had to use since, except in interviews or quizzes. Or quizzes during interviews.</p>

<p>Basically, think of modulus as “remainder” function for division problems. For instance, <code>4 % 2</code> will give a modulus of <code>1</code> because 4 goes into 2 twice, evenly, with zero remainder. On the other hand, <code>5 % 2</code> will give a modulus of <code>1</code> because 5 goes into 2 twice, with a remainder of 1. This turns out to be a handy way to differentiate even (4) and odd (5) numbers.</p>

<p>(note that the <code>else</code> isn’t needed here, but it gives greater clarity to what’s going on)</p>

<h3 id="quiz-3-getfileextension">Quiz 3: getFileExtension</h3>

<h4 id="problem-2">Problem</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function getFileExtension(i) {
    // i will be a string, but it may not have a file extension.
    // return the file extension (with no period) if it has one, otherwise false
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="solution-2">Solution</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function getFileExtension(i) {
    // i will be a string, but it may not have a file extension.
    // return the file extension (with no period) if it has one, otherwise false

    var filenameArray = i.split(”.”);

    if(filenameArray.length &lt;= 1) {
        //  i.e. “foo” becomes [“foo”] (array with 1 member)
        return false;
    } else {
        //  must be an array with more than 1 member.  The extension must be at the end.
        return filenameArray[filenameArray.length - 1];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="explanation-2">Explanation</h4>

<p>Now we’re getting a bit tougher!</p>

<p>Strings have a handy function that splits them into an array: <code>split()</code>. For instance,</p>

<pre lang="javascript"><code>"foo.bar.baz".split(".")
</code></pre>

<p>will output</p>

<pre lang="javascript"><code>["foo", "bar", "baz"]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the periods have been removed, just as the prompt asked for!</p>

<p>In this case we need to first check if there was no file extension. This means that there were no periods to split on, resulting in a one-member array (<code>"foo".split(".")</code> becomes <code>["foo"]</code>). In this case we return <code>false</code>, as the prompt asks for.</p>

<p>Now, in the else case, we know that the array must be larger than 1, meaning that it has a file extension. Since the file extension is always at the end, we know that it must be the last member in the array.</p>

<p>We can find the index of the last member by taking into account array length (<code>filenameArray.length</code>) and the fact that the array is zero-indexed, meaning that we need to subtract 1 from this length. Now we know the extension exists and is at the end of the array, so all we need to do is return it:</p>

<pre lang="javascript"><code>return filenameArray[filenameArray.length - 1];
</code></pre>

<h3 id="quiz-4-longeststring">Quiz 4: longestString</h3>

<h4 id="problem-3">Problem</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function longestString(i) {
    // i will be an array.
    // return the longest string in the array
    
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="solution-3">Solution</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function longestString(i) {
    // i will be an array.
    // return the longest string in the array
 
    var longest = ””,
        n, len;

    for(n=, len=i.length; n&lt;len; n++) {
        if(typeof n[i] !== “string”) {
            //  not a string, go to next iteration of the loop
            continue;
        }

        if(n[i].length &gt; longest.length) {
            //  Current string is longer, so set it as the new longest string
            longest = n[i];
        }
    }   
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="explanation-3">Explanation</h4>

<p>This is a pretty classic interview question. It’s fairly easy and straightforward: just keep track of the longest string in a variable, then loop through all the members of the array. If the current member is longer, set it as the new longest string. At the end, return whatever that variable contains.</p>

<p>Note the extra sanitization check here to make sure the type is a string. If it’s not a string, we <code>continue</code> to continue to the next iteration of the <code>for</code> loop. (Note that this is similar to returning early in functions)</p>

<h3 id="quiz-5-arraysum">Quiz 5: arraySum</h3>

<h4 id="problem-4">Problem</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function arraySum(i) {
    // i will be an array, containing integers, strings and/or arrays like itself.
    // Sum all the integers you find, anywhere in the nest of arrays.   
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="solution-4">Solution</h4>
<pre lang="javascript"><code>function arraySum(i) {
    var sum = ,
        n, len;

    if(typeof i === “number”) {
        //  i has been defined as a simple number through a recursive call
        sum += i;
    } else if(Array.isArray(i)) {
        //  i is an array, so iterate through it
        for(n=, len=i.length; n&lt;len; n++) {
            //  recursive call
            sum += arraySum(i[n]);
        }
    }

    return sum;
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="explanation-4">Explanation</h4>

<p>The best way to handle this one is through recursion, which is tricky but powerful. I admit that on my first attempts writing it in the console, my browser froze up and I had to restart it.</p>

<p>Recursive functions are very elegant but tricky. It helps to step through with examples.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with <code>arraySum(1)</code>. The output is of course 1, but note that we didn’t actually input an array. The code took the first codepath in the <code>if</code> statement (because <code>typeof 1 === "number"</code> is true)</p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we input a basic array:</p>

<pre lang="javascript"><code>arraySum([1]);  // 1
</code></pre>

<p>Again the answer is 1, but this time the codepath was different. This time <code>Array.isArray([1])</code> was true, and the function was called recursively for each of the members in the array. That is to say, each member of the array (in this case the single member) was sent to arraySum as a simple integer. So the recursive call was the same as the original example: <code>arraySum(1)</code>, and the output was the same.</p>

<p>In the case of more numbers, the outputs are all added to the <code>sum</code> and then returned back at the end of the function.</p>

<p>Note that this works quite well for even deeply nested arrays, since arraySum() has logic for arrays that will always return the sum of all of its deeply nested integers:</p>

<pre lang="javascript"><code>arraySum([1, [2,[3,[4,[5]]]]]);   // 15
</code></pre>
