    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/my-year-in-photos-2016</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years back I put together my favorite photos of the year (see it: <a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-2014/">part one</a> and <a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-2014-part-2/">part two</a>).  I decided to resurrect the tradition, and I hope to keep it going in the coming years!</p>

<p>Onto the pics!</p>

<h2 id="february">February</h2>

<p>I visited Yosemite twice, first by myself and later with my friend Kevin.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-01-feb-yosemite-night-sky.jpg 1000 666 Night sky from Yosemite %}</p>

<p>For this shot I drove to the empty Bridalveil Falls parking lot and placed an LED lantern in the middle of the parking lot, then shot straight up.  I was super happy with the way this turned out.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-02-feb-pinecrest-lake-in-snow.jpg 1000 666 Pinecrest Lake in the snow (California, near Yosemite) %}</p>

<p>Interesting tree stumps around Pinecrest Lake area, in the snow.</p>

<h2 id="march">March</h2>

<p>At the end of March, I quit my job and <a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2016/japan-once-again/">ended up in Japan again</a> for the next few months!</p>

<p>One of my favorite photos from the entire several months was taken from the first night at the hotel.  I had a corner room in the Star Gate hotel, which towers over south Osaka and has a great view of the Kansai International Airport.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-03-march-kansai-international-airport.jpg 666 1000 Kansai International Airport seen from the Star Gate Hotel in Osaka, Japan %}</p>

<h2 id="april">April</h2>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-05-april-kiyomizudera-lightup.jpg 1000 666 Kiyomizudera lightup in Kyoto, Japan %}</p>

<p>(<a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2016/monju-e-ceremony-in-nara/">see more photos and video from the Nara Monju-e Ceremony</a>)</p>

<p>I’ve always wanted to ride the shinkansen (bullet train) as far north as I could, and <a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2016/shinkansen-trip-from-kyoto-to-sapporo/">I finally did it</a>.  I boarded the bullet train in Kyoto and ended up at its terminus in Hakodate.  The final stretch of bullet train to Hakodate had only opened days before, and they were still celebrating its completion.</p>

<p>They’re currently building the final stretch from Hakodate to Sapporo, but it’s not due to be complete until sometime in the 2030s or so.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-11-april-rainy-shinkansen.jpg 1000 666 Rainy day on the shinkansen %}</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-12-april-northern-japan-coast.jpg 1000 666 The coast of northern Japan, seen from the shinkansen %}</p>

<p>This isn’t a super great photo, but I thought it was interesting for a few reasons.  There were these stone markers occassionally by the tracks.  And there was also a whole lot of trash, mostly fisherman trash like baubles.</p>

<p>Kind of surprising how much trash was along the coast here, especially for Japan’s reputation for cleanliness.  Was this remants of the 2011 tsunami?  Well, it’s five years later and this stuff is still here…</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-13-april-hakodate-sunset.jpg 1000 666 Hakodate sunset %}</p>

<p>Hakodate is a fun little town.  Of course I had to take the tram up to the top of Mount Hakodate, then watch the sunset with all the other tourists…</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-14-april-hakodate-night-view.jpg 1000 666 Hakodate night view %}</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-15-april-hakodate-night-view.jpg 1000 666 Hakodate night view - the reality of the crowds.  Absolutely packed. %}</p>

<p>Mount Hakodate at sunset was swarming with tourists.  I’m glad I did it once, but I wouldn’t do it again.</p>

<p>Around Hakodate there was this trendy hamburger place called Lucky Pierrot, which looked more like a carnival.  They had some interesting vending machines propped up outside their shop.  Looked like something out of a video game:</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-16-april-hakodate-lucky-pierrot-vending-machine.jpg 666 1000 Lucky Pierrot vending machine %}</p>

<p>Sapporo was still a bit snowy in April!</p>

<p>…And I was totally unprepared.  I took some photos, then had to duck inside somewhere to warm up.  I found a mall with some ramen restaurants and a Uniqlo - both of which had things that could help me warm up.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-18-april-sapporo-ramen.jpg 666 1000 Delicious Sapporo ramen %}</p>

<h2 id="may">May</h2>

<p>In May I visited Indonesia with Yuka, but I was too afraid to bring my DSLR, which was a stupid idea in retrospect.  I took some video there, and took lots of photos with my phone, which I guess I’ll have to post eventually.</p>

<p><a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2016/the-roads-of-indonesia/">Here you can watch a Muslim parade</a>, and <a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2016/indonesia-trip-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">here you can listen to me ramble on about my experience in Indonesia</a>.</p>

<p>When I came back to Japan, it was time to explore some more!</p>

<p>I returned to Byodoin Temple in Nara, which had been restored to its original vermillion colors since my last visit a few years back:</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-19-may-byodoin-temple.jpg 1000 666 Byodoin Temple in Nara %}</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-21-may-kyoto-aqua-marine-diving-school.jpg 1000 666 Aqua Marine Diving School (Kyoto, Japan) %}</p>

<p>This probably isn’t a super interesting photo for you, but I actually walked past this, then thought better of it and walked back to snap a photo, because I thought it was just interesting.  It jumped out again for me when going through my photos, so I had to include it among my favorites just for the subject matter.  The hiragana reads “Diving School”.</p>

<p>Yuka had been wanting to take me up to Mount Rokko for a while.  It was a fun experience riding the cable car to the top, then eating some good food at the top.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-22-may-mount-rokko-cable-car.jpg 666 1000 Accidental self-portrait, and a view from the Mount Rokko cable car (Osaka, Japan) %}</p>

<h2 id="june">June</h2>

<p>In June I tried something new: I gave myself a photo assignment.  Just to go out on a mission, and come back with some tangible decent photos.</p>

<p>I know Kyoto is amazing at night, with lots of things to discover in the nooks and crannies of the city I’ve spent the last few years exploring.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-23-june-kyoto-alleyways-at-night.jpg 666 1000 Kyoto alleyways at night %}</p>

<p>I posted a few more photos from my Kyoto photo assignment <a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2016/photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night/">here</a>.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-25-june-shirakawago.jpg 1000 666 Shirakawago %}</p>

<p>I had mixed emotions about visiting Shirakawago, a UNESCO World Heritage site with a bunch of interesting old thatched houses.  The place was incredibly touristy, and I had a run-in with some pushy Japanese grandmas who unabashedly cut in line in front of me at a gift shop.</p>

<p>It was an interesting place - I may be back eventually in the winter, which is the more common time to take photos of the truly interesting old-fashioned houses.</p>

<p>I brought my DSLR to a short weekend trip to Busan with Yuka, but didn’t take many good photos there.  I did like this one shot of a cute dog in a traditional market though:</p>

<h2 id="october">October</h2>

<p>Back in the US!</p>

<p>I took a few road trips, especially to capture the changing seasons in California.</p>

<p>My mom spontaneously booked a trip to New Orleans, and I agreed to tag along.  It was a nice return to a truly interesting city.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center //davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-best-of-41-nov-new-orleans.jpg 1000 666 The lobby of the W Hotel French Quarter (New Orleans) %}</p>

<p>One last road trip of the year!  Just before Christmas, I took a drive to Zion National Park.  I am definitely returning to this beautiful place, and I’m already planning future hikes and photo shoots here.</p>

<h2 id="july">July</h2>

<p>Yuka was still here in early July, just in time to see Fourth of July fireworks at Big Bear Lake, California, before she had to go back to Japan.</p>

<p>{% imgcap center http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-07-04-christine-fourth-of-july-fireworks-big-bear-lake-california-david-calhoun-5D__3083-3.jpg 666 1000 Christine at the Fourth of July celebrations at Big Bear Lake, California (Photo copyright David Calhoun)  %}</p>

<p>Life was getting pretty boring, so I started driving out places alone.  This was a last-minute trip to Mount Shasta Lavender Farm.  Unfortunately because of the extreme drought conditions, the lavenders weren’t as spectacular.  Also, I mistimed it and arrived too late.  They did have a lavender setup outside of the fields, which the bees were busy at work on.</p>

<h2 id="august">August</h2>
<p>The highlight of August was undoubtedly my first visit to Hawaii with my mom and dad.</p>

<p>Earlier in the month I took a trip off the beaten path at Shoreline Park in Mountain View (where it’s too busy to be peaceful), where I snapped this.  I didn’t see the signs - apparently this was in a restricted area down by the shoreline.</p>

<p>Hawaii!  Mom and Dad were kind enough to show me around all the places they’ve enjoyed visiting.</p>

<p>I went out on a solo drive to the Eastern Sierras, and happened to time it perfectly to see what little autumn colors there were out near Lake Sabrina.  Previously in 2013, I timed it right to see what was then much more yellow colors, along with a throng of photographers.  This time was much more low key - it was a rainy day, and I only saw a few other people.</p>

<p>It started to rain a little heavily towards the end of my shooting, making it extremely difficult.  The camera started fogging up as well.  Of course when I finally did make it back to the car and started to air out, the rain had to die down.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad came up to visit me in October.  We went up north of San Francisco to hike in Muir Woods.  Afterwards we got some good sushi at Sushi Ran in Sauasalito.</p>

<p>At the very end of the month, I took a one week vacation to visit Yuka in Japan.  Even though she had lived in Osaka all her life, she had never really visited Kyoto and Nara, so we visited both.</p>

<p>When Yuka had to return to work, I spent the rest of my vacation in Japan visiting northern Japan.  I think I just missed the peak of the fall leaves, but I still found some good spots.</p>

<h2 id="december">December</h2>
<p>We had Christmas at Mom and Dad’s Big Bear cabin.  After Christmas, we took a long day trip up the 395 up to Bishop, California to pick up some bread and beef jerky.  On the way, Mom took an interesting detour to see Fossil Falls, where there was still a bit of evidence of Native Americans.  Mom even found the petroglyph that she’d seen there years before.</p>

<p>Just today, on the last day of 2014, I hiked up to the top of Mission Peak in Fremont, California, with my coworker Jessica, and Kevin and his wife.  It was really cold, and there were really strong, deafaning winds through the alluvial valley floors.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture of cows grazing on the hills on the hike up.  The pond was partially frozen over.  Kevin lifted up a huge rock and thrust it in, creating a hole in the ice and a really strange, completely new sound that I’ve never heard before.  That’s not something that happens everyday.</p>

<p>Here’s to a new year of new sights, sounds, and experiences.  Cheers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s nearing the year’s end, so of course this means a somewhat sentimental blog post from me.  I was thinking of a “resolutions/goals” type post, but I decided against it.  Instead here’s something more entertaining: my favorite photos from the past year!  Note that these aren’t necessarily my best, just my favorites.</p>

<p>Finding these is also a little bit of housekeeping for me and my photos.  It forces me to sort the gigabytes and gigabytes of RAW photos I was casually dumping onto drives the entire year.</p>

<p>In any case, I did a lot of travelling this year!  I don’t have to think twice to know this is the most I’ve ever travelled in one single year.  Two new US states visited (Louisiana and Florida) and another trip to Japan!</p>

<h2 id="january">January</h2>

<p>Winter is undoubtedly the least crowded season in Yosemite, and yet it’s an interesting time that folks miss out on.  My Honda Accord isn’t the best car for this, but I got lucky and didn’t need to put on chains.</p>

<p>I drove through the park at night, armed with an upgraded camera.  I’d previously tried to take night images with my Canon 7D, but really struggled.  On the other hand, the versatility of my new Canon 5D Mark III really shined here.  I’m still learning though - I’m sure I could do better somehow.</p>

<p>Later that month I had my inevitable 30th birthday, and much love shown to me by my friends and family.</p>

<h2 id="february">February</h2>

<p>I went back to Yosemite with Kevin in February, where I was able to tag along and take advantage of his all wheel drive.  If I brought my Accord, I would’ve definitely had to put on noisy chains.</p>

<p>The trail wasn’t too bad except for a few rough patches with slow and ice.</p>

<h2 id="march">March</h2>
<p>Yuka and I traveled all around the area on weekend trips, sometimes going as far as Lone Pine.</p>

<p>{% imgcap http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-edison-lightbulbs-santa-cruz-verde-coffee-5D__1197-david-calhoun.jpg 1000 666 Edison lightbulbs in Verde Coffee in Santa Cruz (Photo copyright David Calhoun)  %}</p>

<p>This was a super tough shot to get.  It’s supposed to be the moon in the background at dusk.  No tripod - I think I just balanced the camera on my knee?  Manual focused this one.</p>

<p>This was shot at Manzanar, and obviously we arrived way too late, so we decided to come back the next day.</p>

<p>{% imgcap http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-mount-whitney-night-sky-5D__1777-david-calhoun.jpg 1000 666 Snowy Mount Whitney against the night sky (Photo copyright David Calhoun)  %}</p>

<p>The almost full moon was out and in a perfect position to illuminate these snowy mountains.  There was an eerie glow coming from them that you could see with your eyes.  We drove as far as we could on Whitney Portal Road before encountering a road block, beyond which the snow wasn’t cleared.  There were a lot of cars parked here, undoubtedly a lot of people kissing in the dark.</p>

<p>Yuka thought I drive her up here so we could kiss too, but I was too interested in my camera and my photography, so I think I upset her a bit.  She was also scared of the eerie mountains.  Definitely a strange feeling from those lit up mountains that night.</p>

<p>{% imgcap http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-manzanar-and-mountains-5D__2141-david-calhoun.jpg 1000 666 Manzanar monument 慰靈塔 (Soul Consoling Tower) (Photo copyright David Calhoun)  %}</p>

<p>I was amazed at these two cherry trees seemingly in the middle of nowhere, at full bloom.  Certainly something that would’ve attracted much attention if it was in Japan.  But here it was surprisingly uncrowded.</p>

<p>I really doubt I’ll be able to get the timing right on these trees again - I know how time-sensitive they are.  And the high winds in the area must make it tough to get good shots before all the leaves fly away.</p>

<p>The bees were having a field day here!  Never seen so many bees pollinating.</p>

<p>Yuka mentioned visiting the redwoods with a coworker when she was visiting San Jose for work previously.  I was fairly sure it was Big Basin, my favorite place to hike in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>Yuka had a lot of fun, and also discovered tree sap (yes, she instinctually touched it).  Time to get her outdoors more!</p>

<p>New Orleans was a pretty spontaneous trip.  We wanted to fly somewhere, and New Orleans was a place both of us are interested in.</p>

<p>What a great city!  Definitely a party culture which I don’t identify with at all, but more than that: a walkable city with true culture, good food, good music.  And super friendly people.  Strangers who walk past you in the morning and give you an earnest “good morning!” with a smile.  I grew up in LA - my reaction is at first suspicious, but then I realize they’re not asking for money, they’re just being friendly.  What a concept.  What a friendly city!</p>

<p>For better or worse, I became obsessed with brie cheese after eating this, which is a baked wheel of brie cheese with cinammon apples and a clove of garlic on the side, served with crackers and grapes.  I don’t know if it was because I was so hungry from walking so much, but this was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten.  Fantastic!  Now I need to try to recreate this at home sometime.</p>

<p>I last visited Bodie, a real ghosttown, when I was a kid.  I honestly don’t remember much, other than my dad warning me repeatedly to watch where I stepped, and not to step on any nails or any floorboards just lying around.  I also vaguely remember it being hot and dusty.</p>

<p>This trip was made while it was still chilly outside.  The sky was great and perfect.</p>

<p>When I told dad that the last few miles to Bodie is still dirt road, he simply replied “good!”.</p>

<p>I was lucky and really privileged to get invited to speak at JSConf, which I consider the premiere event for JavaScripters.  It’s a fantastically run conference, the best organized I’ve seen, and I was happy and terrified to be invited.  Overall I apparently did alright, but I can’t stand watching my video and think I was entirely too stiff.  I’ve never spoken in front of so many people (it was hundreds in that big main room).</p>

<p>Yuka flew out to see me, and I was so happy to see her again.  We spent time at the Amelia Island resort, but we both kind of decided that resorts weren’t for us.  We decided to explore, so one day we rented a car and drove to St. Augustine, Florida.</p>

<p>Some pieces of history classes came back to me, but to tell you the truth I would never expect there to be Spanish castles and this much Spanish influence left here.  What an interesting place!</p>

<p>Back to local Northern California weekend trips.  Yuka and I enjoyed travelling to Monterey, Morro Bay, Pescadero (garlic/hippy town!), and San Simeon to see Hearst Castle.</p>

<p>We ventured to Sausalito and looked up restaurants on Yelp.  We looked at a few and decided on Sushi Ran.  Expensive but super tasty and nice, and it made Yuka so happy.  We later found out that it’s one of the few Michelin rated restaurants in the area, and was even mentioned by Steve Jobs at the first iPhone keynote as his favorite restaurant in the area.  (note: I REALLY dislike Jobs and his ilk, people who idolize him, but I thought this was an interesting tidbit in any case)</p>

<p>Hearst Castle is another place I visited with my family in childhood, but the memories were still pretty fresh.  Still, it had been over ten years or so.</p>

<p>I remember being fascinated with the ceilings here when I was a kid, so forgive the multiple shots of them.  It’s still hard to capture it all.  The angles here are all so awkward, I’m definitely not used to shooting stuff like this.  This place is probably great for fisheye lenses.</p>
