    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s well into the new year, and I didn’t exactly start the new year off like everyone else, who I imagine all rushed daily into the gym in the first week or two, then apparently gave the habit up soon after.</p>

<p>Sometime in February I found out about a study being conducted at my workplace in conjunction with a university, to track the effects of exercise over the course of a month.  As an extra benefit, I get paid a decent chunk of virtual money into my Google wallet every time I visit a gym in the month of March, during the weekdays.</p>

<p>Now that the study is finally starting, I’m already in the habit of going to the gym and I actually look forward to it.  I actually feel good, and I love the feeling of comign out of the gym and feeling the cool air at night around campus.  For a few minutes I even enjoyed a little stream just outside the gym.</p>

<p>Never thought I’d much like the gym, but I like getting in the habit of going.  It always makes me feel good, and may be a bit of a ward against depression, or at least thoughts I can’t trust.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the previous two photo posts I wanted to avoid this sort of heavy reflection New Year post.  But its time has finally come and it should be said, no matter how cheesy it may sound.</p>

<p>I have been living these last few years of my life as driftwood.  At least professionally.  I have all the makings of what should make me happy and successfully in my career, but it’s an illusion.  I am an imposter.  I am living a life as professional driftwood.</p>

<p>What I mean is this: previously I was very active in trying to establish my career as a web developer.  I read as much as I could, practiced as much as I could, and constantly tried to learn new things that would make me better.</p>

<p>I am living what society calls a good life, but I don’t know myself what a good life really is.  I’m sure it’s not this.</p>

<p>I had always heard of Marshall McCluhan’s famous “the medium is the message”, but really only had a surface level understanding of it until recently, when I first read the essay.</p>

<p>It’s a somewhat eye-opening and challenging piece for various reasons, because it challenges some things I thought I had a good grasp of.  Particularly the repeated shooting-down in the essay of people who claim it’s how the medium is used that matters, not the medium itself.  McCluhan disagrees with this by constantly impressing upon the reader not only that the medium and content are inseparable and come as a whole package, but that there is really no distinction to be made between content and medium.  It’s one medium nicely packaged in another medium.  This is the meaning of “the medium is the message”.</p>

<p>And could we go on?  That one medium could be packaged in another, which is itself packaged in yet another medium?  This certainly doesn’t seem unreasonable, as at one point in the essay it’s argued that speech is a medium for writing, which is yet another medium: the medium for inner thoughts.  Record someone on television giving a speech and you add yet another level.  It’s really mediums all the way down.</p>

<p>The original essay was written on the cusp of the digital information age, and had a concern with the medium of writing getting surpassed by print, which in turn seemed to be getting surpassed by television, radio, and digital information.  Though at times it might seem luddite, anti-television or anti-new-mediums, especially towards the end of the essay, I don’t see that as the intent of the article.  The end of the article was just trying to hit home a point that these mediums have become human appendages, consciously and subconsciously, and they are inescapable.  For better or worse.  The point is that if the mediums are only subconscious, then they influence us and trap us in invisible prisons.  By making us conscious of mediums we can study them and at least try to understand them better than we could at the subconscious level.</p>

<p>More than fifty years after the article was written, we are well into the digital information age, and we are starting to see the Internet surpass television.  The timelessness of The Medium is The Message is that these same insights can be used to understand the pervasiveness of the Internet medium all around us today.  Another important message here was that these mediums pervade and influence culture - just as the printing press played a crucial role in the French Revolution.  And often times we don’t realize these mediums as playing such a pervasive role until after the fact.</p>

<p>Smart phones have just recently invaded our society in our public and personal lives.  Our societies have already been substantially changed and molded by this new medium, and yet only now do we start asking ourselves questions like “is it bad to use my phone too much?”, “is it bad manners to use a phone at the dinner table?”, “is it ok to give a phone to a kid?”.</p>

<p>I’d made assumptions before that the blog posts I write on my website are content-first, so I’ve made an effort to remove any designs or parts of this medium that is distracting to that content.  Hence the super minimalist design I have in place currently.  But I never considered that there are parts of this presentation medium that can’t be sidestepped and avoided.</p>

<p>I had thought that maybe some of my blog posts could be printed and still retain the same message.  However, according to McCluhan this would be impossible, since the medium is married to the message (not to mention that the message is actually just another medium).  On this view the reader’s experience of reading my blog post on their laptop or desktop is an entirely different experience from reading on their phone, in an altogether different environment and in different circumstances (e.g. at home versus riding the train).</p>

<p><figure class='left half'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/kyoto-downtown.jpg" width="1000" height="673" title="Kyoto’s downtown (Photo by David Calhoun, 2011)" ><figcaption>Kyoto’s downtown (Photo by David Calhoun, 2011)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It seems that we can take this even further, to its natural extent.  It seems that every city has a different overall culture and a different feel.  In that sense a city and its people can be assumed to be a sort of very large medium.  A person reading a news article in one city could be reading the same article as a person in a different city.  It seems not unreasonable that their experiences could be very different because their very environment - their city - permeates their experiences.  A city itself as a medium can then help ideas flourish (in a zeitgeist sort of way) or can even stifle ideas.</p>

<p>A city can very well itself be a medium.</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/the-google-bitch"/>
    <updated>2013-09-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/the-google-bitch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I came back from Japan and accepted an offer to work at a startup in Silicon Valley, I knew one of the biggest challenges would be to find a decent and affordable apartment in Mountain View, close to where I’d be working. I had it all planned out, and how healthy and convenient it would be to walk to work and also Mountain View downtown!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this dream was shared by me and hundreds of thousands of other like-minded software engineers. Which isn’t unexpected, really. If you spend enough time in Silicon Valley, everyone’s ideas start to sound the same after a while.</p>

<p>Mountain View, if you didn’t already know, is home to the now omnipresent non-evil company known as Google. Google has been fast taking over Mountain View, building by building, campus extension by campus extension. They even have their name on the sidewalks near where I take walks at work. Because they own those, too. (Actually, they own the fiber connections running beneath them).</p>

<p>One day I went out apartment hunting and was pretty happy the apartment listed earlier in the day hadn’t already sold, as had happened several times earlier (yes, there is THAT much competition).</p>

<p>As I drove up and approached the apartment, I noticed the unwelcoming stare of a single woman waiting outside the complex. She didn’t say anything, so I mentioned that she must be waiting for the apartment walk-through the same as myself. She acknowledged and then mentioned that “he was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago”, referring to the current tenant who was supposed to show up earlier for an apartment viewing.</p>

<p>I saw that she was pretty serious about maintaining that she was here first, and I cracked a joke about folks being cutthroat because of the competition or some such thing, to try to break the tension. I even said it with a smile, which is supposed to prompt at least a crack of a smile in any human capable of empathy. Sadly it had no effect on this poor emotionless woman. It was clear that she was all business.</p>

<p>It’s not dissimilar to the animal kingdom, really. She was just establishing her dominance by passively explaining that she was here before I was. Oh I see, so even if I wanted this place, I’d have no shot at it, because you were here first? I guess that’s what you have to do these days to ensure you get a place…</p>

<p>I hear it’s worse in “The City®” (San Francisco), and I’m not surprised really. The last time I was looking for apartments there, it was a crappy little studio apartment in a crappy part of town, with what looked like 20 people lined up ahead of me to put down a deposit. No thank you. Sometimes I think I’d rather live someplace in the country.</p>

<p>Alright, back to my apartment hunting story in Mountain View. I figured I might as well take a look at the place, since I’d taken the time to come by. Some other folks showed up and started waiting in the same spot, until finally the current tenant came by, apologized for the wait, and took us through the apartment.</p>

<p>To be honest, the apartment was nothing special. It was an older apartment that was part of a fourplex with families with kids on all sides. Not exactly a quiet place. Sure, there was nice lush greenery everywhere, and of course it was conveniently situated in Mountain View, but it was overall not exceptional. But in a bubble economy, the location is now sufficient to make anything special and worth the price.</p>

<p>I asked the current tenant about cable internet availability, and the single woman decided to use her God-given right to interrupt and respond: “The entire city of Mountain View has WiFi provided for free by Google”. Without missing a beat, she added some other talking points as if they were coming out of a pre-prepared handbook. It actually kind of sounded like someone reciting a memorized passage from the Bible. And there was a certain pride behind it, to give me a hint that I need not ask if she worked for the blasted company.</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to say other than, “Oh, that’s cool”. I really wasn’t prepared to deal with corporate shills on what had become an epic search for an apartment.</p>

<p>After looking around a bit more, I was the second to last person to talk to the owner and take an application. He was more than patient with me, but I noticed the very last person waiting in the shadows to talk to him was The Google Bitch. Dammit, so she had some scheme she was waiting to thrust on the poor guy.</p>

<p>As I walked away and went back to my car, still within earshot The Google Bitch made an offer to the guy: “So, I am prepared to put down money today to secure this apartment” she said confidently. The current tenant just said “Wow, ok” and they talked from there.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I never turned in the application, as it would’ve just been a waste of everyone’s time.</p>

<p>I have since settled into an apartment community in Sunnyvale, where I have been adopted by a very extended, loving Indian family. They sometimes give me funny looks when I walk through the complex, but it’s all good. Perhaps the farther from The Google Bitch and people like her, the better.</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/fourth-of-july-letter-to-my-government"/>
    <updated>2013-07-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/fourth-of-july-letter-to-my-government</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(this is a copy of a letter which I’ve sent to various representatives in government)</p>

<p>As a concerned citizen, I know you understand that I must occasionally voice my concern through letters such as this. My hope is that you will honestly consider my claims and take action on my part. I honestly appreciate you taking your time to seriously consider this letter.</p>

<p>I’m writing to you today specifically in response to abuses by the NSA overstepping its bounds. Citizens of the United States and citizens of the world now know its private data is being indiscriminately collected, sifted through, and intruded upon by the NSA. These actions are clearly antithetical to our own Constitution and set a terrible precedent for the future of this country and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Today is the Fourth of July. However, this Fourth of July is a bit different for me. Instead of setting off fireworks and spending time with my family, I am alone in Japan. Yet I am not alone in my concerns that my constitutional rights are being forced away from me.</p>

<p>As you well know, there are protests today in support of restoring the fourth amendment and against organizations such as the NSA which subvert our Constitution in the name of national security. I sincerely wish I could join these rallies, but I must show support by other means, such as through this letter. While I admit it would be interesting to protest the Japanese way, parked at a street intersection shouting my protests through a megaphone, it seems more effective for me to write directly to you. And to other people such as you who have the full time job of representing me and people like myself.</p>

<p>While the US has never been a perfect country, I know it’s had better times. I’m not the only one who believes our nation is now in a bad way. Yet I hope to do my small part to help fix some of these problems in my lifetime, in order to make America a better place for us all. Since we are both Americans, I hope we share this common interest.</p>

<p>My growing list of grievances is too much to list here, therefore I want to focus on recent revelations by whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden. This has been a tipping point for me and many fellow Americans, whom I hope have also been awoken from a dogmatic slumber.</p>

<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, as a result I’ve started to become more of a believer in America. Or rather, what America is intended to be. I’ve recently found myself reading more about the history of my country. I’ve become interested in politics, and for the first time in my life I’ve seriously considered joining a protest. I have become a better citizen in the hope for a better America.</p>

<p>President Obama and others in positions of power have defended these NSA spying programs, responding by explaining that they have come into effect through lawful means. Yet there has been massive public backlash, which I believe should at least warrant a reconsideration of these surveillance programs. I trust people like you to make sure this happens.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that this hasn’t been the first time in recent years the great disconnect between the governed and the government has been exposed. Perhaps our representatives are not really representing our interests after all? The situation isn’t dissimilar to what culminated in the breaking off and founding of our nation in the first place.</p>

<p>It will be a great shame, but perhaps we are part of the generation which collectively allowed the great American experiment to fail?</p>

<p>Update (July 12, 2013):</p>

<p>I received a reply from one of my senators, Diane Fienstein. While it’s a generic reply sent to everyone sending letters similar to my own (http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/nsa-programs), I appreciate some sort of response.</p>

<p>I’m still concerned however. Fienstein argued her case with the same defense as Obama: our repesentatives in the House and Senate voted these spying initiatives into law. Therefore it’s “legal” and was created and approved by people we voted into law.</p>

<p>This is supposed to dissuade my fears in some way, but it actually makes me more apprehensive. Where are the people in government that represent me and my fears? Where are the people in Congress to re-examine the work they’ve made of the Constitution?</p>
