    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve seen Casablanca more than a few times, and it’s become one of my favorite films.  For this review I got to experience it in 35mm at the wonderful nearby Stanford Theatre.</p>

<p>But that’s not how I first experienced it.  I first watched it at home and half paid attention to it.  A lot of the movie was lost on me and I thought it was overrated, just ok, and not that great.  My views have changed, in case you haven’t guessed.</p>

<p>It does seem to be a film that takes repeated viewings to “get”.  The script is brilliant, every line has its place.  If you look away for a few scenes you may miss some clever back and forth that’s worth watching again to catch.</p>

<p>The pacing is mostly great and still holds up well for modern audiences.  I struggled to find a scene that I could get up for popcorn for.  Every scene had classic lines that I didn’t want to miss.</p>

<p>This film is chock full of classic one-liners that have become part of our culture in their own rite really.  It’s through the love of this film that that’s even made possible.</p>

<p>This is a film that is best experienced, not explained in a post like this.  However, that being said, I’ll give this a try anyhow.</p>

<p>I’ve avoided this film all my life out of dread more than anything.  It’s somewhat weird then that I watched this so early in my “Top 100” films quest.  I knew I’d have to watch it eventually anyhow.</p>

<p>Everyone who has seen this said it’s a good movie but is very depressing and dark.  Not that we’d expect anything less from a movie about the grim realities about the Holocaust.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='563'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-02-liquidation-of-the-ghetto-grandmother-and-nazis.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-02-liquidation-of-the-ghetto-grandmother-and-nazis.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="Liquidization of the ghetto.

<p>I came into the movie already knowing that I’d see many people die in gruesome ways, and that I’d see the Nazis misbehaving.  But maybe I’m a bit desensitized.  I’ve seen Nazis act in outrageous ways in movies and videogames all my life.  That familiar Nazi outrageousness, oozing evil, does appear in Schindler’s List.  But here it’s factually grounded, which makes it eerie.  In this movie there is little in the way of an exaggeration - all of these things did happen.</p>

<p>Amon Goeth is the supernazi we are made to hate the most.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='563'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-07-nazi-amon-goeth-with-gun.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-07-nazi-amon-goeth-with-gun.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="Amon Goeth with his rifle.

<p>He appears completely out of control, as he indiscriminately shoots down prisoner Jews like he’s hunting deer.  Or more precisely, shooting fish in a barrel.  I want to somehow think this is a fiction, that this is the product of an overzealous writer looking for new ways to portray Nazis as outrageously evil.  But I look up Goeth and find that he exists, and that he did exact what he is portrayed doing.  That is somehow surprising to me.  I desperately wanted his random shooting to be a work of fiction.</p>

<p>This is a movie that knows how to use extreme contrast to bring focus on things.  It has a few scenes in color, but most of the movie takes place in black and white.  The black and white scenes sometimes include very selective color: the famous girl in a red jacket and the color in the flames of burning candles.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='563'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-06-girl-in-red-coat.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-06-girl-in-red-coat.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="The girl in the red coat." ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>The girl in the red coat.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Schindler picks out a girl in a red coat in the chaos of the liquidation of the ghetto.  He later sees the corpse of the girl that’s been exhumed, to be put on the giant pile of bodies in a mass incineration.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='563'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-10-death-of-the-girl-in-red.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-10-death-of-the-girl-in-red.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="Corpse of the girl in the red coat." ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Corpse of the girl in the red coat.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It’s here that he really shows vulnerability as a character.  He loses his cool exterior and is shocked.  He realizes he needs to do something.  He needs to take action.</p>

<p>It’s here that he creates a list that the movie takes its namesake from.  This is a list of Jews that he will bribe officials to keep at his factory, and keep them safe and away.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='563'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-12-oskar-schindler-and-itzhak-stern.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-12-oskar-schindler-and-itzhak-stern.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="Schindler and Stern drawing up a list." ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Schindler and Stern drawing up a list.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>One part that really resonated with me was the misfortune of a group of women who were on Schindler’s List - the ones who I knew should be protected.  The killing in general is a horrible thing during the film, but it’s a fact and I prepared myself somewhat for it.  When Schindler drew up his list of those he would protect, I became invested in their well-being, because I know they had been chosen to be kept safe.  Somehow I found myself empathizing with them more.</p>

<p>So all the more the shock when a traincar of women who were on his list somehow was diverted to the wrong place.  The train pulls into an eerily familiar-looking courtyard.  We don’t need to be told where this is, but the film lets us know anyway: Auschwitz.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='563'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-13-auschwitz-train-arrival.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-13-auschwitz-train-arrival.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="The train arrives at Auschwitz." ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>The train arrives at Auschwitz.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Auschwitz.  Some of the protected Schindler Jews ended up at Auschwitz?!</p>

<p>What’s worse - they have heard secondhand stories of mass gassings, and they find themselves going through the motions through which what appears to be the same process.  They undress and are herded into the showers.  This could be their end.  But they were on the list - they were the ones that weren’t supposed to die in this movie, right??</p>

<p>But it’s just water, not gas.  A huge relief for the entire group, as naked and helpless as they still are.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='563'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-14-women-in-showers.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/schindlers-list-14-women-in-showers.jpg" width="1000" height="563" title="Women in the showers at Auschwitz." ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Women in the showers at Auschwitz.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>There is also extreme contrast in Schindler himself.  Throughout the movie he is nothing but a smooth character who maintains control and appears to exert control, even when briefly tossed into prison for kissing a Jew.  But this smooth exterior vanishes at the end when he accepts the gift of a ring and starts trembling so much that he drops the ring.  His reaction is almost out of character, because his facade breaks down.  He realizes he could have sold even more of his possessions to save a few more lives, on top of the 1100 lives he has already saved.</p>

<p>The end of the film has an artful transition into the current day, with the real remaining Schindler Jews at the time paying their respects to Schinder’s grave.</p>

<p>Of course this is a film that needs to be seen by all for historical reasons and also for future reasons.  We don’t want a repeat of anything like these events, and this film alone convinces viewers of that.</p>

    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/ikiru-1952-top-100-films</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='729'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-title-card.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-title-card.jpg" width="1000" height="729" title="IKIRU, 生きる, TO LIVE" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>IKIRU, 生きる, TO LIVE</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>This is an existentialist story about a man who learns he has stomach cancer, leading to his reconsidering of life, which he realizes has been utterly wasted up until this point.</p>

<p>As it turns out, he realizes he hasn’t really been living at all.  What’s inadvertently happened is that his job has turned into his life - the job of being section chief at one of the endless wasteful government bureaucracies.  From the point of his diagnosis, his challenge is trying, in the brief life he has left, to figure out what it means to actually live.  Thus the name of the film in English: TO LIVE.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='732'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-dark-lighting.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-dark-lighting.jpg" width="1000" height="732"><figcaption itemprop='caption'></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>This is a sad and deeply disturbing film, not disturbing in the explicit sense of a horror or a war movie, but disturbing because these are the horrors of everyday life.  It is too real: the horror of mundane office life, of government bureaucracy, of the disconnect between life and work, of a cancer slowly eating away at remaining life, of life’s clock itself ticking down, chiming each hour closer to death.  The horror of growing old and losing vitality and life’s energy.</p>

<p>In the very opening of the film, a group of women is petitioning a government agency to turn a cesspool into a children’s park and playground.  In typical government fashion, the responsibility is pushed from department to department, with no one department wanting to take responsibility.  Thus the park becomes a pretty clearly established MacGuffin.</p>

<p>The protagonist - Kenji Watanabe - has been diagnosed with stomach cancer, but is initially alone in his discomfort, with no one close or trusting enough to help him.  Even the doctors themselves are distrustful, as they don’t directly tell him his diagnosis - Watanabe has to find out indirectly.  After his diagnosis he walks outside of the hospital and we get the sense that he no longer belongs in the world - the busy street with with cars speeding by is in a sense life itself passing by - something that is now very alien.</p>

<p>It’s a world in which he no longer belongs.</p>

<p>He’s an outcast at work, the boring boss figurehead who’s probably in his position based on seniority alone.  He’s also an outcast at home, where his wife died many years ago, and where he now lives with his ungrateful and highly dislikable son and his son’s girlfriend.  He reflects on his life which was devoted to his son, and wants to break the news of his cancer to him.  He looks for various ways to tell him.  But the son has turned his back on him and effectively blocks him out.</p>

<p>There’s no one close enough for Watanabe to break the news to.  The first person he tells is a complete stranger at a bar, an apparently alcoholic struggling writer.  Watanabe eventually confesses that he wants to learn how to live life, and asks the writer to help him spend his money all at once, while he still has time.  The writer refuses his money and instead offers to pay with his own money, which immediately makes him the first character Watanabe can trust.  They go out and visit all the vices of nightlife in the city: booze, clubs, loud bars, crowded dance halls, stripteases.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='732'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-bar.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-bar.jpg" width="1000" height="732" title="Experiencing life at the bar" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Experiencing life at the bar</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>They find themselves at a club with a piano player playing a boogie-woogie tune which people are energetically dancing to.  People dancing, full of life.</p>

<p>Watanabe requests an old song which gives away his age: the hit of 1915, Gondola no Uta (ゴンドラの唄, “The Gondola Song”).  People try to dance to it, but he sings in such a depressing way that is a downer for everyone there.  The camera pulls back from the face of the writer, whose thin and pale face is baring his lower teeth, and his whole appearing perhaps not coincidentally resembling a skeleton, utterly in shock.</p>

<p>The night ends with a taxiride home with some revolting and annoying prostitutes.  Watanabe has to get the taxi to stop so he can vomit on the sidewalk.  It’s the reminder of his stomach ulcer, a problem that cannot be drunk away.</p>

<p>But it turns out these places aren’t what Watanabe is looking for.  The day after, he roams the streets continuing to look, and by chance runs into a young girl from work.  A girl that is still very full of life, as revealed by her innocent full smile.  A girl that doesn’t belong at Watanabe’s workplace, and is consequently quitting.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='732'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-smiling-girl.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/ikiru-smiling-girl.jpg" width="1000" height="732" title="" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Back home, the son has blocked him out with his newspaper, and the son’s girlfriend with her knitting and furtive glances.  They are so resistant and are unable to listen.  They think he’s having a relationship with the young girl from the office, and accuse without even listening to Watanabe.</p>

<p>Watanabe meets with the girl one last time, and finally confesses that he has cancer and not long to live, and that his life has been a waste.  He confesses that the girl brings out some life still remaining in him.</p>

<p>The girl is now working at a factory making toy bunnies, and she explains how she feels as if by making the toys she’s reaching out to all the children across the Japan.  She has found a workplace where she belongs.  She has found meaning in her work.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try making something too?” she says.</p>

<p>And then his haunting reply: “It’s too late.”</p>

<p>But soon after he appears to have a realization.  He leaves the girl and walks straight out of the restaurant, with a clear and definitely purpose.  It’s the last we see of the girl - she’s served her purpose in showing him the way.  “Happy birthday to you” is playing for a young girl as Watanabe is exiting the scene, but it’s really his birthday, or rather his rebirth.</p>

<p>“Happy birthday to you” plays again as Watanabe goes out to personally inspect the future park site - this becomes his life goal.  The challenge that no government agency wanted to take on.</p>

<p>Then the scene cuts to five months later.  Suddenly Watanabe is dead.</p>

<p>This is the climax of the film, which happens at a somewhat unusual place.  The rest of the story is told through his funeral and flashbacks.  This is really my only complaint with the movie - we have to spend the rest of the movie in a room with people we’ve grown to dislike and distrust.  Coworkers, bureaucrats, and the uncaring son and girlfriend.  The bureaucrats continue bureaucrating, and try to take credit for building Watanabe’s park, an effort they all quickly turned down at the beginning of the film.</p>

<p>Then very briefly, some people we trust and care about: the group of women originally petitioning for the park arrive and mourn very intently at Watanabe’s altar, an act of sincerity which inadvertently shames the insincere bickering bureaucrats.</p>

<p>Then we return to the room of people we dislike, and we are forced to spend more time with these unlikeable characters.  Because of this I think this part just drags on much longer than needed, and slows down the pacing of the film.  But then there is some redemption: some of the bureaucrats finally acknowledge Watanabe’s efforts, and they appear to be themselves inspired and changed.</p>

<p>We also get flashbacks of Watanabe stubbornly running up against challenge after challenge to get the park built, even in the face of gangsters, presumably the Yakuza, who showed him leniency.  I think this is worth showing briefly, but it’s already been strongly established that this government is a very inefficient and resistant to change, so much of this seems like unnecessary storyline that makes the film drag.</p>

<p>However, all this waiting and slow pacing leads to a worthwhile payoff: the policeman stopping by the funeral to return Watanabe’s hat and pay his respects.  He’s the one that recounts the very beautiful scene with Watanabe singing his Gondola Song on a swing in his new park, amidst falling fresh snow.  That’s the last we see of Watanabe alive, and how truly alive and happy he was.</p>

<p>The film ends with a strong hint that some coworkers’ attitudes and behaviors have now been changed by Watanabe, and that his efforts have affected more change than just the children’s playground.  His actions have really lead to a greater good in the world.</p>

<p>This has become one of my favorite films, for the very reason that it’s a challenge to how we should live.  This is how art and how films can improve our lives and make us better people - they involve us in a world and let us learn from the characters in that world.  And from this film is the challenge calling out clearly: live your life, create, don’t waste your life, do good through your work.</p>
