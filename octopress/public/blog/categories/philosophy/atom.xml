    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From Soren Kierkegaard’s “Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits”</p>

<p>(this excerpt is from Provocations, excerpts from Kierkegaard, Plough)</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a wood dove. It had its nest in the fearsome forest, where wonder and apprehension dwelt together, among the erect, lonely trees. But nearby, where the smoke rises up from the farmer”s house, lived some tame doves. The wood dove would often meet a pair of these. He would sit on a branch that stretched out over the farmyard, not far from the two tame doves on the ridge of the roof. One day they were talking together about how things were going and about making a living. The wood dove said, “Up until now I have made my living by letting each day have its own troubles, and in that way I get through life just fine.” The tame dove, not without preening itself, answered: “No, we manage differently; with us, that is with the rich farmer with whom we live, our future is secure. At harvest time, my mate and I sit up on the roof and watch. The farmer brings in so many loads of corn that I know we are secure for a very long time. We two are well provided for and have our guaranteed security.”</p>

<p>When the wood dove returned home he pondered the matter. It occurred to him that it must be a great comfort to know that one”s living was secure for a long time, and what a wretched thing it was to always live in uncertainty. “It would be best,” he told himself, “to gather a great stockpile and store it here or there in some safe place.”</p>

<p>The next morning the wood dove woke earlier than usual. He got to work right away and was so busy gathering and storing that he scarcely had time to eat. But as fate seemed to hang over him, every time he had collected a little supply and hidden it away, when he came to look for it, it was gone! Meanwhile there was no actual change about making a living. He found his food every day as before. And yet a great change had taken place. He did not suffer actual want, but he had acquired the anticipation of need in the future. His peace of mind was lost. He had become anxious about the necessities of life.</p>

<p>From now on, the wood dove began to worry. His feathers lost their glint of color, his flight lost buoyancy. He was no longer joyful; indeed, he was almost envious of the rich, tame doves. He found his food each day, ate his fill, and yet he was not satisfied. In worrying about his needs he had trapped himself in a snare in which no birdcatcher could have trapped him, trapped as only a free creature can trap himself. “This securing of the future is constantly on my mind,” he said. “Oh why am I a poor wood dove and not one of those rich ones?”</p>

<p>He saw plainly that anxiety was taking its toll on him, and so he spoke seriously to himself, yet not so seriously that he could drive away the worry from his mind and set his heart at rest. No, he only spoke in such a way that he convinced himself that his care was justified. “I am not asking anything unreasonable or impossible,” he said. “I do not ask to become like the wealthy farmer, but only like one of the rich doves.”</p>

<p>Finally, he contrived a scheme. One day he flew over and sat between the tame doves on the ridge of the farmer”s roof. He noticed a place where they flew in, so he flew in too, because surely the storeroom had to be there. But when the farmer came home in the evening and shut the dovecote, he discovered the strange dove. He immediately put it into a little box by itself until the next day, when it was killed “ and released from its worries about the necessities of life! Alas, the worried wood dove had not only trapped himself in worry but also in the dovecote “ to its death!</p>

<p>The wood dove is like us silly human beings. When a person is content with the dignity of being human, then he understands that his heavenly Father feeds him. This he learns from the birds of the air. He does not live like the tame birds in the house of the wealthy farmer, but in the house of him who is richer than everyone, for heaven and earth are the house and possession of God, and humankind is his guest.</p>

<p>A person must be content to be as he is; a dependent being, as little capable of sustaining himself as of creating himself. If we choose to forget God and look after our own sustenance, then we are overcome with anxiety. It is certainly praiseworthy and pleasing to God when a person works for his food. But if he forgets God, and thinks that he himself is supporting himself, then he becomes burdened with the necessities of life. Let us not foolishly and small-mindedly say that the wealthy are spared this anxiety, while the poor are not. On the contrary, only he is spared who is content with being human and understands that his heavenly Father feeds him. And this is as possible for the wealthy as is it for the poor.</p>

<p>Worry about making a living, or not making a living, is a snare. In actuality, it is the snare. No external power, no actual circumstance, can trap a person. If a person chooses to be his own providence, then he will go quite ingenuously into his own trap, the wealthy as well as the poor. If he wants to entrench himself in his own plot of ground that is not under God”s care, then he is living, though he does not acknowledge it, in a prison. When the farmer shut the door on the wood dove, the wood dove believed himself to be safe, when in fact he was caught. Or to put it another way, he was shut out from the care of Providence and trapped in a life of anxiety. In a spiritual sense he made himself a captive “trapped himself unto death.”</p>

    <updated>2017-07-09T20:10:02-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2017/stifling-laughter-in-distant-places</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="new-cultures">New Cultures</h3>

<p>The first days of traveling usually involves laughing at the quaint and unusual customs of another culture.  That sounds close-minded, because in many cases it probably is.  But it’s something we all do, of course including yours truly.  Maybe it’s a coping mechanism - laughing at things in the face of difficulties and differences.</p>

<p>To be fair, we’re thinking creatures, and as such it’s pretty hard for us not to draw comparisons with our own home city and culture.  Especially when we spot things that we consider outdated in our own culture.  Our reaction may be disgust (“Fax machines?!  Didn’t those go extinct in the 90s?!”) or nostalgia (“Ahh decent customer service - it’s been way too long”).</p>

<p>After one or two weeks, and we may still be poking fun at the quirks of our temporarily home.  But this changes when we settle in for the long term.  Weeks turn to months, and the funny quirks become more visible, in just the same way as quirks of spouses are discovered, as we’re forced to live with them each day.  Laughter at those quirks can turn to annoyance, and not far beyond that is outright hatred.</p>

<h3 id="the-marriage-analogy">The Marriage Analogy</h3>

<p>I don’t think the marriage analogy is too much of a stretch - living in a city can almost be like being married (though I can only guess): each day venturing out from our beds we have to confront the city or the spouse daily, and encounter both the good and the bad just to get through with the day.  At least with cities we can escape into our own rooms and private spaces.  But with marriage there is often no room to escape to, except maybe the bathroom.  This may explain why men sometimes spend so long in these very private places…</p>

<p>In a relationship, some of the personal quirks we discover are at first quaint, but our attitude can soon progress to annoyance, or worse.  If we’re unable to tolerate the quirks, our hatred can soon multiply and be reason for divorce. Or on the other end of the analogy: emigration from the city.  Us leaving the city is sort of like a break up or divorce.</p>

<p>I’m not sure about what you think, but I think this progression from laughter to annoyance to hatred doesn’t seem too productive.  What if we try to go down a quite different path, one which doesn’t start with laughter and disdain?  Maybe this path will take us to a better place.</p>

<p>At the very least, outright laughter at foreign customs does seem to be a sort of childlike reaction, because it’s unskilled: it’s basically a quick judgement and unrestrained laughter.</p>

<h3 id="people-do-things-differently--and-thats-usually-ok">People Do Things Differently.  And That’s (usually) OK.</h3>

<p>It reminds me of the scene in To Kill A Mockingbird where a poor boy is invited to the Finch household.  At breakfast, the poor kid steeps his entire breakfast in syrup, much to the disgust of the Finch girl.  She starts to react, but Atticus, the father, calmly quiets her.  His reaction at “foreign” customs is more mature - he doesn’t laugh, but instead looks past the poor boy making all his food soggy with syrup.  The boy is a guest, and what’s more, the moral of the whole story is tolerance of different folks and their ways.  Atticus is the hero of the story, and the one who sets an example for his daughter.  And for us.</p>

<p>In our travels we’ll often come across things that seem backwards in some way on first appearance.  And it may go deeper than appearance - many of these things may turn out to actually be very backwards.  But it helps me to try to have patience, to suspend judgement and give the benefit of a doubt.  For instance, Japan has an unusually rigid culture with a structured way of doing things, even small things such as opening small packages of food by pulling the correct tabs on the packaging.  In the correct order.  To do otherwise is simply incorrect.  After being corrected constantly on tiny little ways I was doing things wrong, I started to go mad.  My initial reaction was wanting to rebel, to do things my own way.  I think this approach still has merit, if we have the right attitude towards it.</p>

<p>It helps to remind myself that there’s a structure in the culture for a reason, because it’s worked well for decades (or maybe centuries), and while there may be better ways, this way is the way this culture works best.  It’s pragmatic.  It may change over time, but for the moment this is the smoothest way for everything to harmonize.</p>

<p>But you aren’t part of that culture, so you may very well find more efficient ways to do things.  Perhaps you’ll bypass the tabs on the food packaging and take some scissors to the whole thing, ignoring the instructions.  I think that’s fine - finding a way that works for you.  Just don’t laugh at other folks for doing things differently.  Though conversely, the natives will probably laugh at you and try to constantly correct you.  I guess you’ll have to get used to it.</p>

<h3 id="your-options">Your Options</h3>

<p>As a foreigner you have a few options:</p>

<p>-adopt the ways of the culture and love it<br />
-adopt the ways of the culture, but secretly hate it and resent it<br />
-do things your own way, and tolerate the other ways<br />
-do things your own way, and secretly hate and resent the other ways</p>

<p>Which of these works best?  I guess you can experiment for yourself and draw your own conclusions!  Judge for yourself!</p>

    <updated>2017-01-11T22:35:47-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2017/beginning-thoughts-on-the-idea-of-a-great-american-road-trip</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The idea of a trip across the United States has become somewhat of an American institution.  Something like a New American Dream, this one maybe a bit more accessible than that house, happy life, and nuclear family with 2.5 kids.  It’s something that is undertaken by both the young and the old, with the former perhaps hitchhiking or sleeping in their cars while the latter leapfrog between National Parks in their expensive and comfortable motor homes.</p>

<p>It’s something that can be undertaken alone, along a lonely journey which becomes a sort of vision quest to find one’s purpose.  Or it can be undertaken with friends and family, and turned into more of a quest to check off bucket list destinations and to experience America.</p>

<p>Whatever the circumstance, the thought of the American Road Trip hangs in the back of every American’s mind in some way.  I can’t help think that there is daily at least one person stuck in a cubicle or trapped in a job behind a computer screen that isn’t tempted in some way to recklessly abandon their current situation and make plans to hit the road.  Even if the trip amounts to nothing, and no progress on a sense of life purpose, at the very least there is a thrill of escape, of running away from the daily struggle.  What a thrill, like escaping a prison - a prison we’ve willingly signed up for.</p>

<p>And why not take a chance?  It’s like the escape of running off to travel the world, except much less expensive and with far less communication barriers along the way.</p>

<p>Of course I should say that anyone lucky enough to be in circumstances to even entertain these thoughts is privileged.  I’m sure some shake their heads in disgust that such spoiled people aren’t content, and feel the need to escape from their comfortable life.</p>

<p>Maybe the person wanting to make a jailbreak is a millenial such as myself, somewho is spoiled, never had to truly struggle as generations past, and all through life lead along nowhere-in-particular with a carrot-on-a-stick, a buildup to the glorious present.  The present, which turned out to be the mundane grind of a meaningless job that happens to pay well, and maybe continues to spoil you with free food and other perks, in the hopes to stifle those existential pains.</p>

<p>We have all this and then still complain?  I know why folks are outraged at the thought, but this struggle isn’t new, and the American Road Trip has always been a cross-generational outlet to find one’s purpose in the face of mundane reality.  I’m not sure how far back you have to go to be considered a “millenial”, but stretching it back to Jack Kerouac’s <em>On The Road</em> would be reaching.</p>

<p>A bit of a side note: but I thought I was Generation Y, not Millenial?  Or are they the same?  I never really liked being lumped into a category, especially one based on a time period in which I was born.  Next thing you know, folks will be analyzing personalities based on their birth month.  But I guess we’ll leave that to astrology and other bunk.</p>

<p>In any case, why not explore the possibilities?</p>

<p>If I stayed in a good but meaningless job where my ego was stroked and my belly and wallet fattened, that would be a sure way to come out in ten years as a bored, unfulfilled, fat, entitled individual.  And ten years older at that, probably with debts and a mortgage to pay off for life (the terms of the sentence).  Perhaps I’d become lazy and never challenged myself to get out and explore different possibilities, different ways of making a living.  Perhaps I’d never considered that I could make money doing other things, that I could seriously consider and try other modes of living, or at least observe them in others as I sped by their world in my car.</p>

<p>What better way of doing all that, than on a trip across the country?  Where you could get out and see how different folks existing and living in various ways?  What a taste of all the options, all the possibilities.  At the very least you could figure out if the air smelled differently in different parts, if people talked differently, if folks were kinder in some parts or had different attitudes.  What a shame never to experience it.</p>

<p>Many folks may be comparatively well-off to be able to undertake such an adventure.  But what a truly great adventure it must be!  What a truly great opportunity, and what a privilege to have the option to look at these possibilities and to turn them over in one’s mind for days on end, to take them seriously and try to understand them.</p>

<p>Socrates once said:</p>

<blockquote>
Besides, it is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit.
<br /><br />
αἰσχρὸν δὲ καὶ τὸ διὰ τὴν ἀμέλειαν γηρᾶναι, πρὶν ἰδεῖν ἑαυτὸν ποῖος ἂν κάλλιστος καὶ κράτιστος τῷ σώματι γένοιτο
<br /><br />
(from Xenophon's Memorabilia)
</blockquote>

<p>This can also be applied to our mental life, and our way of living.  We have the opportunity to push our bodies to its limits to test it and know how much we are possible of.</p>

<p>How much can we push our comfort zone and know other ways of living, and to explore those possibilities?  What a shame to grow old and never have experienced those limits.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many folks, including yours truly, have had an unpleasant night, and this morning a bitter awakening at the announcement that our new President will be Trump.  For most folks this comes as a shock, as we have all thought the chances of this happening were slim.  Comedians chided him on and dared him to run.  Even President Obama who continually roasted him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mzJhvC-8E">at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in 2011</a>, arguably the defining moment when Trump became driven to run for President (“He certainly would bring some change to the White House”).</p>

<p>The whole experience has been surreal, and I suppose many folks took it for granted that last night we would finally would wake from such a crazy nightmare.  But we haven’t waken up.  This is America for the next four years.  And now, as rational people, we need to come to terms with this and figure out how to deal with this.  Rationally.</p>

<p>Just as Michael Moore did before the election, when he articulated a very personal understanding of Trump’s base of support:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKeYbEOSqYc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Trump the person of course has always been shocking, and that he’s progressed this far is more shocking.  It will be so hard to think of him ever being “presidential”.  The thing is, he can only have made it so far by being backed by MANY supporters, the viewpoints of which clearly so many of us have failed to understand.  Perhaps out of our own lack of empathy.</p>

<p>It’s clear that so many of us have still failed to understand, with some explanations that Hillary lost largely because America is misogynist.  Or that Trump’s supporters are all old, racist, uneducated, white hillbillies out in flyover country.</p>

<p>These arguments are simply intellectually lazy, and they should be identified as such.</p>

<p>To be sure, there are plenty of racist Trump supporters who have created enough spectacles on their own, apart from Trump creating his own spectacles which we all gobbled up.  Heck, the KKK endorsing Trump was a spectacle on its own (the KKK also endorsed Reagan, but unlike Trump he was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/02/us/reagan-spurns-klan-support.html">quite vocal against them</a>).</p>

<p>The point here is that it’s a logical leap to say that the majority of Trump supporters are this way.  This is simply a lazy stereotype that uncritically pushes these supporters to the sidelines.</p>

<p>Ironically and sadly, we continue to have a very surface-level understand of Trump supporters.  But why should we be so supportive of folks with alternative ways of life, such as LGBT folks, but immediately dismissive of Trump supporters?  The truth is that it’s much easier to write off these folks as 100% racist, block them on social media, laugh at them, and shut then down, than to understand them.  The same motivation that encourages folks to flee communities that don’t share their political opinions.</p>

<p>What do folks expect from people whose voices are silenced?  They turn more extremist than you could possibly imagine.  Sadly, I think some of them do turn resentful and become racist and sexist, when they would have had no incentive to do so otherwise.</p>

<p>If you find yourself growing up in a middle America town, but find yourself not fitting in politically, surely you are silenced and shut down in a similar way.  If you are not “one of them”, how are you supposed to even engage in debate, except by fleeing flyover country and joining the rest of your like-minded folks on either coast?  Further dividing these united states, segregating ideologies into geographic echo chambers.</p>

<p>It must be something driven by human nature, something that drives folks apart and into like-minded groups.  Something that is comfortable, no doubt.  It’s definitely more comfortable to flee different viewpoints than to struggle to understand them.</p>

<p>But maybe it’s more healthy for us to embrace discomfort?  I don’t know.  I just know that whatever we’re doing now isn’t working.</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/quine-and-heidegger-against-reductionism/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-19T22:15:05-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/quine-and-heidegger-against-reductionism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<meta itemprop="mainEntityOfPage" content="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism" />

<p>Earlier this year I had the opportunity to attend my first philosophy class in about a decade.  The class was on the infamous philosopher Martin Heidegger, and the course was taught at Stanford University by Forrest Hartman (PHI 98: An Introduction to Martin Heidegger (Spring 2016)).</p>

<p>Heidegger is famous for being obscure and notoriously difficult to read, but I believe I made some headway in what turned out to be a very interesting philosophy.  Most interestingly, though Heidegger is considered to be a “continental” philosophy, I found some common ground with Quine, who is considered to be an “analytical” philosophy, supposedly in a diametrically opposed camp.</p>

<p>I’ve been meaning to post this for a while - this is the paper I wrote for the class.  Would be interested in any feedback!</p>

<p>For convenience, <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/writing/David%20Calhoun%20-%20Quine%20and%20Heidegger.pdf">here it is in PDF form</a>!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Comparing two thinkers from opposite philosophical traditions may initially seem like an impossible and fruitless task, a sort of culture clash two cultures cognitively thousands of miles apart.  It should be easy to find the points of departure between Quine and Heidegger<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but what I’m more looking forward to here is what seems to be an eerie agreement on a few key topics, in particular reactions against science: a move back towards accepting metaphysics, against the dominant trend of their time.  And a move away from a reductionist approach and towards a more holist view of knowledge.</p>

<p>Their seeming agreement here is almost as if two wanderers have hiked up a mountain from opposite sides, eventually arriving at the same peak.  And when two very different thinkers end up at similar positions, at the very least I think we should have a look.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-look-at-quine">A quick look at Quine</h2>

<p>It makes sense to take a look at Quine first, because he represents a tradition which Heidegger is reacting against.  Being from the analytic philosophical tradition, Quine sees his work as a continuation of the philosophical tradition initiated by Descartes (modernism).  A tradition that strives for exactness in methods and in its own writings, seeking clarity and concision<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.  This all seems well and good coming from the point of view of science, however this tradition has been criticized for being too focused on language and science, too sterile and academic, and consequently for ordinary people, not only inaccessible but sadly irrelevant for them.</p>

<p>Quine himself wouldn’t argue that science should be so closely tied to philosophy: in Quine’s view, philosophy somewhat cohabitates with science<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.  And sometimes philosophy is even secondary, as something that comes along afterwards in order to clarify and clean up little messes and points of ambiguity that science has left behind.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>How can we even begin to understand the world with this approach?  For science, phenomena is king: it is from phenomena that we get observation sentences, which are foundational for scientific understanding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Typical observation sentences are about bodies: ‘This is a table,’ ‘This table is square,’ ‘The cat is on the mat.’. Always the situation that makes an observation sentence true will be a situation that is intersubjectively observable; that is, it will be the sort of situation to which multiple witnesses could, if present, attest.”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s important to note here that this methodology distinguishes between witnesses and bodies; between subjects and objects.  Unfortunately this disconnect has lead to many problems for this philosophy and its descendants: subjects can never have direct access to objects<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.  Consequently there is always an untraversable distance between us and our world; the extreme of this being external world skepticism, that we can never be sure we have knowledge of the world as it <em>really</em> is in itself.  This troublesome view seems to be confirmed by the “progress” of philosophy through the centuries: philosophical frameworks are confidently built up only to be later gleefully destroyed in a seemingly endless churn.</p>

<p>What is the nature of reality?  Who knows, but the next generation of philosophers will surely have a different answer.  This long and seemingly unsuccessful churning of philosophy was one of the reasons for Descartes’ radical questioning, and wanting to rebuild philosophy on firm foundations.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Yet science cannot afford to endlessly doubt, sit still and not make progress, and so it must start somewhere.  The best science can hope for is a sort of pragmatic approach: to aggregate multiple observation sentences from multiple subjects (the “multiple witnesses” in the statement above), and hope that the observations agree.  For a philosophy based on science, these observations end up being foundational for all meaning and knowledge.  This leads to a logical extreme, the verification theory of meaning, the theory that “…the meaning of a statement is the method of empirically confirming or infirming it.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>.  In other words, an extreme approach which <em>reduces all meaning down to merely scientific observation sentences</em>.</p>

<p>Quine reacts against this view in his most famous paper, Two Dogmas of Empiricism, and it’s here that we find strange similarities to Heidegger’s views in Being and Time.</p>

<p>But more on this later, since first we need to consider Heidegger’s own approach.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-look-at-heidegger">A quick look at Heidegger</h2>

<p>Heidegger himself comes from the continental philosophical tradition and sees his work in opposition to Descartes in many ways.  We would say he represents a sense of anti or post-modernism.  Some would also accuse him of being obscure and difficult to understand, in many cases purposely unclear and imprecise<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup>.  Also, some might see Heidegger’s stance as anti-science<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup>, though this is a mischaracterization, at least of the Heidegger of Being and Time, which is my focus here.</p>

<p>For Heidegger, philosophy is clearly the starting point for knowledge, that which must be made clear before examining other domains such as the sciences<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>.  Heidegger’s project is actually similar to Descartes’ in the sense that both are looking for a foundation, a starting point from which to begin philosophy.  Descartes looks to build from a firm <em>epistemic foundation</em>, obsessed with certainty: starting from the only thing which he can’t reasonably doubt: that he exists.  The famous cogito ergo sum: “I think, therefore I am”.</p>

<p>But Heidegger takes him to task for not digging deep enough: “he leaves the ‘sum’ completely undiscussed, even though it is regarded as no less primordial than the cogito.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup>  This “sum”, the “I am”, is what Heidegger calls Dasein, the study of which he thinks should be prior to all other study.  Dasein isn’t a what but a who.  Dasein is <em>us</em>, something that is mysteriously close and yet far: “that which is ontically closest and well known, is ontologically the farthest and not known at all”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>.  Heidegger thinks we should not start with epistemology as Descartes did, but with metaphysics, specifically with the <em>fundamental ontology</em> of Dasein.</p>

<p>Here the method of examining Dasein might strike us as very unusual, because the very nature of Dasein refuses to be categorized as any other object that has properties to be examined, like Descartes’ “thinking substance”.  No, Dasein is something strange and is not like other beings: it cannot be talked about as a what but as a <em>who</em><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>, as a living-through experiences<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>, of intentional actions<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup>.  It’s not something which we can study with our scientific toolbox, the world of subject and object.  (Note that we need not throw out the idea of subject/object entirely, only when discussing Dasein<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Also, there is no problem of not being able to see <em>things in themselves</em> for Heidegger.  There is no untraversable distance between subject and object with Dasein, because there is no subject/object distinction.  Dasein <em>experiences things as they are in themselves</em>, albeit in a different way than the Kantian sense.</p>

<p>Note that we cannot also apply science’s familiar reductionist strategy here: Dasein is not some object to be broken into parts which can then be classified and understood individually<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup>, then added up again to understand Dasein as a whole.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup>  One of the reasons being that it’s problematic that we would even know how to “put the world together again”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> - that already-knowing-how is exactly what Heidegger is trying to uncover: trying to “get behind” or get “prior” to this already-knowing-how to put the pieces back together.</p>

<p>Yet we can still talk about Dasein’s structure<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> in what Heidegger calls “existentialia”: various ways of describing states of Dasein’s Being<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup>, perhaps most importantly for our discussion: Dasein being-in-the-world (in a sense the world is “embedded”, but in a different way than things are usually “being-in” each other – it’s difficult here to avoid the subject-object language we’re usually accustomed to<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup>).  Being-in-the-world and other structures of Dasein turn out to be equiprimordial: they are prior and impossible to “get behind”, so much so that they must be presupposed and cannot be questioned<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What’s vital to understand here is that it’s impossible to take any of these “existentialia” out of the world and look at them in isolation, then look at them individually as if in a petri dish; the scientific approach of reducing our world down into smaller, more understandable parts.  These structures of Dasein can only be examined in relation to each other as part of a whole, as a part of a holistic understanding.  To examine in isolation is to examine away from its natural habitat, and thus what Heidegger would call an “inappropriate” study that yields no understanding.  Instead of examining parts in isolation, Heidegger’s “hermeneutical circle” approach is both an attempt at expressing this difficult holism and also an explanation of Dasein’s ontological understanding of itself<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-thinkers-compared">The two thinkers compared</h2>

<p>Coming back to our comparison with Quine, it may be very difficult at this point to see where Heidegger might have any points of agreement at all.  Heidegger in a sense seems to have jumped into the deep end of metaphysics, starting philosophy at the farthest point away from empiricism (science).  And from everything I’ve outlined above, we may think that Quine would here be on the front lines defending science against these strange speculative metaphysics of Dasein.  But the reality turns out to be quite different.</p>

<p>In his well-known Two Dogmas of Empiricism, Quine goes on the attack against the logical positivists, an extreme group of empiricists who fundamentally believed that all truths can be <em>broken down into pieces</em> that end up being either analytic (such as mathematical proofs) or synthetic (such as scientific statements)<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup>.  Both points of Quine’s attack end up forcing us out of this extreme reductionist view and into a position that forces us to embrace a sort of holism, in a very different sort of way than the traditional scientific reductionist view.</p>

<p>Quine’s first point of attack is against a distinction that goes back to Kant: that truths are either analytic or synthetic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Analytic sentences: propositions “grounded in meanings independently of matters of fact”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> - such as “all bachelors are unmarried”, which are supposedly able to speak for themselves in complete isolation, like mathematical truths.</li>
  <li>Synthetic truths: propositions that we must go out into the world to find out about – sentences such as “bachelors are lonely people”.  These are the sorts of truths uncovered by empiricism (science).</li>
</ol>

<p>Quine attacks this distinction by explaining that it’s impossible to even explain how analytic sentences have meaning in isolation.  For instance, how do we know that “bachelor” is equivalent to “unmarried man” - don’t we have to consult a dictionary or have some prior knowledge to make such a statement?  We also must have some of idea of synonymy <em>beforehand</em>, to understand the very meaning behind something like “A is the same as - is synonymous with - B” in order to understand a sentence such as “all bachelors are unmarried”.</p>

<p>It turns out that “pure” analytic sentences are not so pure after all: in every case it’s impossible to understand the sentence in isolation, without appealing to some wider body of knowledge.  In each case, as Heidegger might say, there is <em>always-already an idea of synonymy</em>, and for that language speaker, always-already an understanding of the meaning of “bachelor” and “unmarried”.</p>

<p>The result of Quine’s discussion is that it seems there is no distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions at all: there actually appear to be no true analytic sentences that can “stand on their own”.</p>

<p>The second prong of Quine’s attack is more explicitly against reductionism in general, which is somewhat a continuation of his first attack.  Where Quine was previously attacking isolated analytic sentences as incomprehensible, he also says it makes no sense to talk about synthetic statements being meaningful by themselves.  No, observation sentences, of science and otherwise, only have meaning in relation to a larger body of observation sentences, an entire <em>web of belief</em>.  And it turns out that one observation sentence might challenge the whole web of belief and force some beliefs to be rejected, while in other cases supporting other beliefs.</p>

<p>Each observation sentence affects the whole web of belief.   Each observation sentence <em>has meaning only in relation to the whole web of belief</em>.</p>

<p>This should seem very similar to what we discussed previously in regards to Heidegger’s hermeneutic circle approach, and his resistance to talking about any of the existialia by themselves, in isolation from the others.  Just as Quine argued that one observation sentence by itself has no meaning, but only meaning in relation to the whole web of belief, so too does Heidegger argue that it’s inappropriate to speak of the existialia of Dasien without understanding its activity, its be-ing, in the whole of Dasein.  That is to say, the whole hermeneutic circle approach.</p>

<h2 id="leaving-the-door-open-for-metaphysics">Leaving the door open for metaphysics</h2>

<p>Also, as it turns out, in the wake of Quine’s attack on logical positivism, it once again becomes useful to look towards metaphysics, something science in general seems to try to shy away from.  Where logical positivists were trying to shut the door on all metaphysics, Quine now puts his foot in the door, leaving open the possibility to talk about metaphysics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The same normativity which leads Quine to attack logical positivism … encourages a more modest metaphysical attitude … it would seem sensible to be liberal about the possibilities of speculative metaphysics. Quine blurs the boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science…”<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leaving open the possibility for metaphysics is of course crucial, as all of Heidegger’s philosophy starts with metaphysics: the fundamental ontology of Dasein.  Yet of course Quine is still coming from perspective of the vastly different scientific different world, and would definitely not agree that philosophy should start with metaphysics like Heidegger does.</p>

<p>In a way, Heidegger has his own view about how we must approach philosophy, but he accommodates science and allows it to be useful and to exist in its own world as a regional ontology.  And Quine, though coming from a scientific background, has his own view about how we must approach philosophy, his own argument moderates the extreme scientific view of the logical positivists and actually ends up accommodating metaphysics, keeping the door open for speculative metaphysics such as Heidegger’s.</p>

Thus the circle of understanding is not a methodological circle, making it unnecessary for us at the end of the process of interpretation, but it describes an element of the ontological structure of understanding. An understanding is fundamentally circular. Heidegger appeals to the hermeneutical circle in order to express the existential fore‐structure of Dasein - according to his view, understanding ontologically occurs in a circular manner.
