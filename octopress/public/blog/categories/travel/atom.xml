<p>On my last trip to Yosemite, I tagged along with my friends Kevin and Mari.  The first day we hiked in rain to the base of Upper Yosemite Falls.  By the second day, we were tired and looking for something quick and relaxing to do before driving back.</p>

<p>We decided to check out the Sugar Pine Railroad, which was right next to their hotel.</p>

<p>I remember passing by the railroad when I went to Yosemite with Yuka, and she seemed really excited to check it out.  Regrettably we didn’t have any time on that trip, and I sort of dismissed it as a tourist trap.</p>

<p>Yep, it’s a tourist trap.  But it’s historical and interesting, and it was fun to relax and take a ride on the old steam engine.</p>

<p>On the last stretch of the journey, there was a bunch of steam that came out of the side of the railroad.  I don’t really understand the reason for this - to let out pressure maybe?</p>

<p>Or maybe a good spectable for the tourists?  :)</p>

<p>We sat right next to the loudspeaker.  I’d advise against that.</p>

    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2015/tourist-season-in-japan-cafe-rhinebeck-kyoto</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0292-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Inside Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Inside Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>(I originally wrote this while sitting in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan)</p>

<p>I’m visiting Japan again, when part of me is constantly thinking I should instead be spending the time and money exploring other parts of the world.</p>

<p>I guess I just find myself coming back to the familiar and (somewhat) comfortable.  I find that I have the same habit when returning to a restaurant, and ordering the same item from the menu each and every time.  This is what I’ve always done at Roger’s, a sandwich place near where I work.  I guess this sounds kind of silly, but Japan is basically my club sandwich, the old standby which I know won’t disappoint.</p>

<p>The trouble with this is getting stuck in a rut. And if you do it too much, you may end up hating that once beloved club sandwich.</p>

<p>Thankfully, much of my previous difficulties with the language barrier have been bridged, which removes much of the frustration when traveling to Japan.</p>

<p>(However, soon after I confidently typed this, I feel like I missed a beat after ordering a second coffee - sounded like she said “osagaishimasu, ne” [a fraud, eh??] with a pause after, where I just responded by blankly staring into space and hoping it was just some typical rhetoric not requiring a reply on my part.  Oops).</p>

<p>Japan is still difficult in many ways, but now it seems most of these troubles stem from spending too much time in big cities and typical tourist destinations, which are especially crowded this time of the year.  It’s been a while since visiting Japan in the spring as a tourist, and I didn’t realize how many tourists there are here now.  Maybe there’s more than there used to be?</p>

<p>Of course this time around I’m not a student, only another tourist, so I’m contributing to the madness.</p>

<p>They are bursting out of public transportation and meandering their way through the typical attractions, and being loud in all their various languages, and staring around wide-eyed at everything, even me.  “Hey look, it’s another foreigner!” their eyes seem to say.  If Japan is your adults’ Disneyland, stare at the salarymen animatronics, not the other tourists!</p>

<p>Gaijin-to-gaijin interaction has always been really strange in Japan, like they indignantly expect something out of you.  People have written entire posts about the subject.  Perhaps I need to set aside a post of my own sometime.  Or maybe I just need to forget about it - it’s not something I have to worry about anymore.  Perhaps I never really had to truly worry about it.</p>

<p>In addition to all the western tourists, there are of course also tons of Japanese tourists from other parts of Japan, coming to enjoy the cherry blossoms.  And like everyone else, they are scrambling to snap billions of photos of the damned blossoms with their selfie-sticks and tablets and random devices.</p>

<blockquote>
"The cherries’ only fault: the crowds that gather when they bloom"
Saigyo, 12th-century poet
</blockquote>

<p>When I returned to Todaiji in Nara to see the Great Buddha, there was of course a big crowd.  I picked this day to finally try my small Glidecam, my new gadget which is great for stabilizing video.</p>

<p>Eventually I just had to sit down on one of the benches in the Great Buddha Hall and realize I was just contributing to the cameras and all the madness.  Though it was difficult to concentrate, I had to sit there for a while with my thoughts.  Something in me has changed.  All this feels different.  The childlike wonder of this place was somehow gone from me.  It’s the last feeling I wanted to feel.</p>

<p>I spent the next two days in my hotel room in Shin-Osaka.  Maybe it was depression or exhaustion, I don’t know.  I didn’t feel comfortable doing anything or interacting with anyone.</p>

<p>Last night I finally left the room and went out to a local bar to get some pizza, some comfort food I guess.  The bartenders were more than gracious and had good friendly personalities.  Good warm Osaka personalities, definitely not the image of a typical Japanese person in Tokyo.  And more genuinely friendly than any server I’d talked to in the Bay Area (except for a great lady serving at the Ahwahnee restaurant in Yosemite).</p>

<p>Today I finally got to abuse my JR Pass.  And by abuse I mean ride it one only one stop.  I stayed at Shin-Osaka station, so I was able to hop on the Shinkansen into Kyoto (~15 minutes), then take the subway a few stops and walk to Rhinebeck Cafe from there (the cafe is definitely not easily accessible).</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0309-david-calhoun.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Coffee at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Coffee at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It’s a great Kyoto cafe hidden away in an old neighborhood with narrow streets with blind intersections that even persuade normally dauntless taxis to be cautious.</p>

<p>The cafe seems a strange combination: a pancake house inside of an old machiya.</p>

<p>Pancakes?  Machiya?</p>

<p>Pancakes need no explanation, although I should mention they’ve gotten popular inside Japan in the last few years (I’ve also read that the average weight of Japanese people is increasing…).</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0273-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Pancake menu at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Pancake menu at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Machiya?  Ok, that needs a bit of explanation.  A machiya is basically an old traditional Japanese house.  Wooden.  Not modern.  With all sorts of special refined Japanese words for all the various parts of the house, I’m certain.</p>

<p>With modern pancakes inside a traditional machiya, in a way this cafe is a perfect representation of Kyoto: a city with one foot in the past and one foot trying to advance into the future.</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0278-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Eat Desert First at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Eat Desert First at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0279-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Couch and table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Couch and table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The space is small but comfortable, with a small traditional garden outside in a courtyard which leads to the bathrooms.  Even after you order you are still taking in the atmosphere.  Then you realize you are breathing some of it: you can distinctly smell the wood ceiling and beams holding it all together.</p>

<p>I’m disappointed because my camera will pick up sights and even sounds, but there’s no way to capture the nice relaxing wood fragrance here.</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0280-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Notepad and pen at the table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Notepad and pen at the table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>There’s a small notepad with a pen on each table, where customers can doodle and leave messages.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of art students in Kyoto, so the little notepads are inevitably filled with strange creatures recently emerged from their creators’ brain.</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0313-david-calhoun.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Drawings on a notepad in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Drawings on a notepad in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>And suddenly, a temporary disturbance…</p>

<p>A truck goes by, blasting its message through a loudspeaker into the streets and through the thin walls of the cafe.  It’s election time in Japan.  And you’re forced to hear it for a minute or so until it passes by.  I hope they outlaw those trucks someday.</p>

<p>In any case, this is basically the Japan I love.  The warm and uncrowded cafe.</p>

<p>No matter how beautiful the sakura are outside, I’d rather spend my hours here.</p>

<p>Yuka was still here in early July, just in time to see Fourth of July fireworks at Big Bear Lake, California, before she had to go back to Japan.</p>

<p>Life was getting pretty boring, so I started driving out places alone.  This was a last-minute trip to Mount Shasta Lavender Farm.  Unfortunately because of the extreme drought conditions, the lavenders weren’t as spectacular.  Also, I mistimed it and arrived too late.  They did have a lavender setup outside of the fields, which the bees were busy at work on.</p>

<h2 id="august">August</h2>
<p>The highlight of August was undoubtedly my first visit to Hawaii with my mom and dad.</p>

<p>Earlier in the month I took a trip off the beaten path at Shoreline Park in Mountain View (where it’s too busy to be peaceful), where I snapped this.  I didn’t see the signs - apparently this was in a restricted area down by the shoreline.</p>

<h2 id="september">September</h2>
<p>I went out on a solo drive to the Eastern Sierras, and happened to time it perfectly to see what little autumn colors there were out near Lake Sabrina.  Previously in 2013, I timed it right to see what was then much more yellow colors, along with a throng of photographers.  This time was much more low key - it was a rainy day, and I only saw a few other people.</p>

<p>It started to rain a little heavily towards the end of my shooting, making it extremely difficult.  The camera started fogging up as well.  Of course when I finally did make it back to the car and started to air out, the rain had to die down.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad came up to visit me in October.  We went up north of San Francisco to hike in Muir Woods.  Afterwards we got some good sushi at Sushi Ran in Sauasalito.</p>

<p>At the very end of the month, I took a one week vacation to visit Yuka in Japan.  Even though she had lived in Osaka all her life, she had never really visited Kyoto and Nara, so we visited both.</p>

<p>When Yuka had to return to work, I spent the rest of my vacation in Japan visiting northern Japan.  I think I just missed the peak of the fall leaves, but I still found some good spots.</p>

<h2 id="december">December</h2>
<p>We had Christmas at Mom and Dad’s Big Bear cabin.  After Christmas, we took a long day trip up the 395 up to Bishop, California to pick up some bread and beef jerky.  On the way, Mom took an interesting detour to see Fossil Falls, where there was still a bit of evidence of Native Americans.  Mom even found the petroglyph that she’d seen there years before.</p>

<p>Just today, on the last day of 2014, I hiked up to the top of Mission Peak in Fremont, California, with my coworker Jessica, and Kevin and his wife.  It was really cold, and there were really strong, deafaning winds through the alluvial valley floors.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture of cows grazing on the hills on the hike up.  The pond was partially frozen over.  Kevin lifted up a huge rock and thrust it in, creating a hole in the ice and a really strange, completely new sound that I’ve never heard before.  That’s not something that happens everyday.</p>

<p>Here’s to a new year of new sights, sounds, and experiences.  Cheers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s nearing the year’s end, so of course this means a somewhat sentimental blog post from me.  I was thinking of a “resolutions/goals” type post, but I decided against it.  Instead here’s something more entertaining: my favorite photos from the past year!  Note that these aren’t necessarily my best, just my favorites.</p>

<p>Finding these is also a little bit of housekeeping for me and my photos.  It forces me to sort the gigabytes and gigabytes of RAW photos I was casually dumping onto drives the entire year.</p>

<p>In any case, I did a lot of travelling this year!  I don’t have to think twice to know this is the most I’ve ever travelled in one single year.  Two new US states visited (Louisiana and Florida) and another trip to Japan!</p>

<p>Winter is undoubtedly the least crowded season in Yosemite, and yet it’s an interesting time that folks miss out on.  My Honda Accord isn’t the best car for this, but I got lucky and didn’t need to put on chains.</p>

<p>I drove through the park at night, armed with an upgraded camera.  I’d previously tried to take night images with my Canon 7D, but really struggled.  On the other hand, the versatility of my new Canon 5D Mark III really shined here.  I’m still learning though - I’m sure I could do better somehow.</p>

<p>Later that month I had my inevitable 30th birthday, and much love shown to me by my friends and family.</p>

<h2 id="february">February</h2>

<p>I went back to Yosemite with Kevin in February, where I was able to tag along and take advantage of his all wheel drive.  If I brought my Accord, I would’ve definitely had to put on noisy chains.</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-02-yosemite-icicles-5D__0825-david-calhoun.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Icicles on the trail at Yosemite (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Icicles on the trail at Yosemite (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The trail wasn’t too bad except for a few rough patches with slow and ice.</p>

<h2 id="march">March</h2>
<p>Yuka and I traveled all around the area on weekend trips, sometimes going as far as Lone Pine.</p>

<p><figure class=''><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-edison-lightbulbs-santa-cruz-verde-coffee-5D__1197-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Edison lightbulbs in Verde Coffee in Santa Cruz (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Edison lightbulbs in Verde Coffee in Santa Cruz (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>This was a super tough shot to get.  It’s supposed to be the moon in the background at dusk.  No tripod - I think I just balanced the camera on my knee?  Manual focused this one.</p>

<p>This was shot at Manzanar, and obviously we arrived way too late, so we decided to come back the next day.</p>

<p><figure class=''><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-mount-whitney-night-sky-5D__1777-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Snowy Mount Whitney against the night sky (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Snowy Mount Whitney against the night sky (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The almost full moon was out and in a perfect position to illuminate these snowy mountains.  There was an eerie glow coming from them that you could see with your eyes.  We drove as far as we could on Whitney Portal Road before encountering a road block, beyond which the snow wasn’t cleared.  There were a lot of cars parked here, undoubtedly a lot of people kissing in the dark.</p>

<p>Yuka thought I drive her up here so we could kiss too, but I was too interested in my camera and my photography, so I think I upset her a bit.  She was also scared of the eerie mountains.  Definitely a strange feeling from those lit up mountains that night.</p>

<p><figure class=''><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/2014-03-manzanar-and-mountains-5D__2141-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Manzanar monument 慰靈塔 (Soul Consoling Tower) (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Manzanar monument 慰靈塔 (Soul Consoling Tower) (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>I was amazed at these two cherry trees seemingly in the middle of nowhere, at full bloom.  Certainly something that would’ve attracted much attention if it was in Japan.  But here it was surprisingly uncrowded.</p>

<p>I really doubt I’ll be able to get the timing right on these trees again - I know how time-sensitive they are.  And the high winds in the area must make it tough to get good shots before all the leaves fly away.</p>

<p>The bees were having a field day here!  Never seen so many bees pollinating.</p>

<p>Yuka mentioned visiting the redwoods with a coworker when she was visiting San Jose for work previously.  I was fairly sure it was Big Basin, my favorite place to hike in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>Yuka had a lot of fun, and also discovered tree sap (yes, she instinctually touched it).  Time to get her outdoors more!</p>

<p>New Orleans was a pretty spontaneous trip.  We wanted to fly somewhere, and New Orleans was a place both of us are interested in.</p>

<p>What a great city!  Definitely a party culture which I don’t identify with at all, but more than that: a walkable city with true culture, good food, good music.  And super friendly people.  Strangers who walk past you in the morning and give you an earnest “good morning!” with a smile.  I grew up in LA - my reaction is at first suspicious, but then I realize they’re not asking for money, they’re just being friendly.  What a concept.  What a friendly city!</p>

<p>For better or worse, I became obsessed with brie cheese after eating this, which is a baked wheel of brie cheese with cinammon apples and a clove of garlic on the side, served with crackers and grapes.  I don’t know if it was because I was so hungry from walking so much, but this was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten.  Fantastic!  Now I need to try to recreate this at home sometime.</p>

<p>I last visited Bodie, a real ghosttown, when I was a kid.  I honestly don’t remember much, other than my dad warning me repeatedly to watch where I stepped, and not to step on any nails or any floorboards just lying around.  I also vaguely remember it being hot and dusty.</p>

<p>This trip was made while it was still chilly outside.  The sky was great and perfect.</p>

<p>When I told dad that the last few miles to Bodie is still dirt road, he simply replied “good!”.</p>

<p>I was lucky and really privileged to get invited to speak at JSConf, which I consider the premiere event for JavaScripters.  It’s a fantastically run conference, the best organized I’ve seen, and I was happy and terrified to be invited.  Overall I apparently did alright, but I can’t stand watching my video and think I was entirely too stiff.  I’ve never spoken in front of so many people (it was hundreds in that big main room).</p>

<p>Yuka flew out to see me, and I was so happy to see her again.  We spent time at the Amelia Island resort, but we both kind of decided that resorts weren’t for us.  We decided to explore, so one day we rented a car and drove to St. Augustine, Florida.</p>

<p>Some pieces of history classes came back to me, but to tell you the truth I would never expect there to be Spanish castles and this much Spanish influence left here.  What an interesting place!</p>

<p>Back to local Northern California weekend trips.  Yuka and I enjoyed travelling to Monterey, Morro Bay, Pescadero (garlic/hippy town!), and San Simeon to see Hearst Castle.</p>

<p>We ventured to Sausalito and looked up restaurants on Yelp.  We looked at a few and decided on Sushi Ran.  Expensive but super tasty and nice, and it made Yuka so happy.  We later found out that it’s one of the few Michelin rated restaurants in the area, and was even mentioned by Steve Jobs at the first iPhone keynote as his favorite restaurant in the area.  (note: I REALLY dislike Jobs and his ilk, people who idolize him, but I thought this was an interesting tidbit in any case)</p>

<p>Hearst Castle is another place I visited with my family in childhood, but the memories were still pretty fresh.  Still, it had been over ten years or so.</p>

<p>I remember being fascinated with the ceilings here when I was a kid, so forgive the multiple shots of them.  It’s still hard to capture it all.  The angles here are all so awkward, I’m definitely not used to shooting stuff like this.  This place is probably great for fisheye lenses.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/franksvalli/15026495731/"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/milky-way-galaxyrise-from-maui-hawaii.jpg" alt="Milky Way galaxyrise from Maui (at the Mauian hotel)" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>

<p>I was lucky enough to finally visit Hawaii with my parents.  Being experts Hawaii tourists, they set us up in a nice traditional resort called The Mauian - a nice quiet(er) little place that has a time for “quiet hours” (apparently the other resorts are places to party).</p>

<p>We got back to the hotel a little after quiet hours, and my folks mentioned that you could see the Milky Way quite clearly.  Being Hawaii, and Maui at that, there wasn’t a lot of light pollution like we’re used to.  I thought I better not miss the chance, and went and grabbed my 16-35mm f/2.8.</p>

<p>I didn’t bring any sort of a tripod on this trip, so I grabbed my spare pants and rolled them up a bit, then rested the camera on them.  Not too bad, actually.</p>

<p>The final settings: 16mm f/2.8, 4 seconds @ ISO 6400.  I was also sure to move to manual focus and set the focus at the sweet-spot (live view helps a bit here).</p>

<p>There was surprisingly little post-processing.  I added the usual tweaks to highlights and shadows and adjusted the black and white levels very slightly.  Added a bit of clarity and a bit of vibrance to bring out the colors.  This was at ISO 6400, so I added some noise reduction combined with some sharpening.</p>

<p>Recently I have been lusting after a nicer astrophotography lens, the 24mm f/1.4, but this photo I took with my existing gear mostly proved to me that I can make do with what I have.  Also, location matters the most.  You can’t get these kinds of shots from where I live without driving hundreds and hundreds of miles away.</p>
