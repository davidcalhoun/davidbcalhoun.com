    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many folks, including yours truly, have had an unpleasant night, and this morning a bitter awakening at the announcement that our new President will be Trump.  For most folks this comes as a shock, as we have all thought the chances of this happening were slim.  Comedians chided him on and dared him to run.  Even President Obama who continually roasted him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mzJhvC-8E">at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in 2011</a>, arguably the defining moment when Trump became driven to run for President (“He certainly would bring some change to the White House”).</p>

<p>The whole experience has been surreal, and I suppose many folks took it for granted that last night we would finally would wake from such a crazy nightmare.  But we haven’t waken up.  This is America for the next four years.  And now, as rational people, we need to come to terms with this and figure out how to deal with this.  Rationally.</p>

<p>Just as Michael Moore did before the election, when he articulated a very personal understanding of Trump’s base of support:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKeYbEOSqYc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Trump the person of course has always been shocking, and that he’s progressed this far is more shocking.  It will be so hard to think of him ever being “presidential”.  The thing is, he can only have made it so far by being backed by MANY supporters, the viewpoints of which clearly so many of us have failed to understand.  Perhaps out of our own lack of empathy.</p>

<p>It’s clear that so many of us have still failed to understand, with some explanations that Hillary lost largely because America is misogynist.  Or that Trump’s supporters are all old, racist, uneducated, white hillbillies out in flyover country.</p>

<p>These arguments are simply intellectually lazy, and they should be identified as such.</p>

<p>To be sure, there are plenty of racist Trump supporters who have created enough spectacles on their own, apart from Trump creating his own spectacles which we all gobbled up.  Heck, the KKK endorsing Trump was a spectacle on its own (the KKK also endorsed Reagan, but unlike Trump he was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/02/us/reagan-spurns-klan-support.html">quite vocal against them</a>).</p>

<p>The point here is that it’s a logical leap to say that the majority of Trump supporters are this way.  This is simply a lazy stereotype that uncritically pushes these supporters to the sidelines.</p>

<p>Ironically and sadly, we continue to have a very surface-level understand of Trump supporters.  But why should we be so supportive of folks with alternative ways of life, such as LGBT folks, but immediately dismissive of Trump supporters?  The truth is that it’s much easier to write off these folks as 100% racist, block them on social media, laugh at them, and shut then down, than to understand them.  The same motivation that encourages folks to flee communities that don’t share their political opinions.</p>

<p>What do folks expect from people whose voices are silenced?  They turn more extremist than you could possibly imagine.  Sadly, I think some of them do turn resentful and become racist and sexist, when they would have had no incentive to do so otherwise.</p>

<p>If you find yourself growing up in a middle America town, but find yourself not fitting in politically, surely you are silenced and shut down in a similar way.  If you are not “one of them”, how are you supposed to even engage in debate, except by fleeing flyover country and joining the rest of your like-minded folks on either coast?  Further dividing these united states, segregating ideologies into geographic echo chambers.</p>

<p>It must be something driven by human nature, something that drives folks apart and into like-minded groups.  Something that is comfortable, no doubt.  It’s definitely more comfortable to flee different viewpoints than to struggle to understand them.</p>

<p>But maybe it’s more healthy for us to embrace discomfort?  I don’t know.  I just know that whatever we’re doing now isn’t working.</p>

    <updated>2016-10-13T17:06:26-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2016/junk-food-politics-tv-body-mind-truth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We Americans believe we have a right to be the way we want to be, which includes being lazy physically and intellectually. Junk is more shiny and more entertaining than non-junk, after all, and we can’t be bothered to be bored with non-junk.  We now have many forms of poison that we unwittingly ingest in various ways.  We have created in many ways our own version of the gladiator games that the masses celebrated through the downfall of Rome.</p>

<p>We are attracted to politicians for their image over all else. Never mind the arguments, or the truth which all politicians unabashedly lay claim to.  Did they speak in a confident way at the last debate? That’s what I really care about.  Because confidence is what we really need in a leader, over all else. Did they provide nice entertaining zingers in rebuttal to their opponent?  Because those witty one-liners are what we need to lead the free world.</p>

<p>Did someone sniffle during the last debate? Did someone stumble over their words? Did someone physically stumble and need help getting into their van?  Did Mr. Funny Man With A Funny Name ask a question at the debate?  I forgot what question he asked, or what the answers were.  What brand was his sweater?  I’d like to wear it this Halloween so I can poke fun at people who don’t appear super polished on TV.  These are the things that really matter.</p>

<p>This is no doubt the era of image politics, not issue politics (arguably this has been happening since the Kennedy-Nixon debates…).</p>

<p>Just like junk image politics, junk TV is more entertaining than non-junk TV, and we are attracted to it like flies to garbage. Cable TV has become a cesspool, and not coincidentally. Networks have found what people are attracted to, and maximized its airing time in order to maximize viewers.  Create masses of junk, and people will flock to it.</p>

<p>And food!  We are attracted to junk food, and not just snacks - even junk added to our main meals. I would argue that the staple food of the US is now sugar. It’s in everything. We eat it with abandon and oftentimes unknowingly. Without regard for long-term effects and without regard for how it affects our bodies and minds.</p>

<p>Because we have a God-given American right to eat what we want, just like our forefathers intended.  George Washington would be proud that I ate a fruit rollup for breakfast, followed by two burgers for lunch.</p>

<p>And we defend our body images in all shapes and sizes, because we have a right to it, dammit.  And we are beautiful and healthy regardless of what anyone says. I have a right to live my life the way I want to, without regard for what anyone else says. That’s the American Way©, after all (copyrighted by North American Coca-Cola).</p>

<p>We defend our version of the truth, because we have a God-given right to it. I have a right to believe what I want to. It’s the American Way to live my life and believe what I want to.  If you question or challenge me, you are attacking my very way of life.  And that’s super unamerican.</p>

<p>We defend the position of our in-group, and anything said against that position is an attack on the in-group itself. We have a right to our position, and it’s more important to show confidence and unwavering commitment to that position than to show hesitancy and a wavering opinion.  And we like to blast our politicians for waffling on positions, never thinking that maybe it’s healthy to reassess beliefs over time.  I’m gonna stick to my guns on this one.</p>

<p>America is undoubtedly in a decline.</p>

<p>And we have a God-given right to be in decline, dammit!</p>

    <link href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/fourth-of-july-letter-to-my-government"/>
    <updated>2013-07-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://davidbcalhoun.com/2013/fourth-of-july-letter-to-my-government</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(this is a copy of a letter which I’ve sent to various representatives in government)</p>

<p>As a concerned citizen, I know you understand that I must occasionally voice my concern through letters such as this. My hope is that you will honestly consider my claims and take action on my part. I honestly appreciate you taking your time to seriously consider this letter.</p>

<p>I’m writing to you today specifically in response to abuses by the NSA overstepping its bounds. Citizens of the United States and citizens of the world now know its private data is being indiscriminately collected, sifted through, and intruded upon by the NSA. These actions are clearly antithetical to our own Constitution and set a terrible precedent for the future of this country and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Today is the Fourth of July. However, this Fourth of July is a bit different for me. Instead of setting off fireworks and spending time with my family, I am alone in Japan. Yet I am not alone in my concerns that my constitutional rights are being forced away from me.</p>

<p>As you well know, there are protests today in support of restoring the fourth amendment and against organizations such as the NSA which subvert our Constitution in the name of national security. I sincerely wish I could join these rallies, but I must show support by other means, such as through this letter. While I admit it would be interesting to protest the Japanese way, parked at a street intersection shouting my protests through a megaphone, it seems more effective for me to write directly to you. And to other people such as you who have the full time job of representing me and people like myself.</p>

<p>While the US has never been a perfect country, I know it’s had better times. I’m not the only one who believes our nation is now in a bad way. Yet I hope to do my small part to help fix some of these problems in my lifetime, in order to make America a better place for us all. Since we are both Americans, I hope we share this common interest.</p>

<p>My growing list of grievances is too much to list here, therefore I want to focus on recent revelations by whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden. This has been a tipping point for me and many fellow Americans, whom I hope have also been awoken from a dogmatic slumber.</p>

<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, as a result I’ve started to become more of a believer in America. Or rather, what America is intended to be. I’ve recently found myself reading more about the history of my country. I’ve become interested in politics, and for the first time in my life I’ve seriously considered joining a protest. I have become a better citizen in the hope for a better America.</p>

<p>President Obama and others in positions of power have defended these NSA spying programs, responding by explaining that they have come into effect through lawful means. Yet there has been massive public backlash, which I believe should at least warrant a reconsideration of these surveillance programs. I trust people like you to make sure this happens.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that this hasn’t been the first time in recent years the great disconnect between the governed and the government has been exposed. Perhaps our representatives are not really representing our interests after all? The situation isn’t dissimilar to what culminated in the breaking off and founding of our nation in the first place.</p>

<p>It will be a great shame, but perhaps we are part of the generation which collectively allowed the great American experiment to fail?</p>

<p>Update (July 12, 2013):</p>

<p>I received a reply from one of my senators, Diane Fienstein. While it’s a generic reply sent to everyone sending letters similar to my own (http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/nsa-programs), I appreciate some sort of response.</p>

<p>I’m still concerned however. Fienstein argued her case with the same defense as Obama: our repesentatives in the House and Senate voted these spying initiatives into law. Therefore it’s “legal” and was created and approved by people we voted into law.</p>

<p>This is supposed to dissuade my fears in some way, but it actually makes me more apprehensive. Where are the people in government that represent me and my fears? Where are the people in Congress to re-examine the work they’ve made of the Constitution?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[<img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/george-friedman-stratfor.jpg" alt="Stratfor CEO George Friedman" title="Stratfor CEO George Friedman" class="size-full wp-image-943" />][1]  <br />
<em>“…but the hackers will not find intelligence of corporations and governments, or signs of a vast conspiracy…” -Stratfor CEO George Friedman, January 2012</em></p>

<p>…eight months later…</p>

<p><em>“WIKILEAKS: Surveillance Cameras Around The Country Are Being Used In A Huge Spy Network” -Business Insider, August 2012</em></p>

<p>In case you haven’t noticed, there been some big news released recently as a result of another release of documents by Wikileaks on August 9, 2012. The documents are [emails from the global intelligence company Stratfor][2]. The most recent release has confirmed what many conspiracy theorists have feared for years: that the government is operating a vast secret surveillance network that is collecting data on citizens and their movements.</p>

<p>The news has been surprisingly (or unsurprisingly?) absent from major news sources, so I’ve collected a few of the major articles here:</p>

<p>[http://www.salon.com/2012/08/10/biggest_story_you_missed_7/][3]<br />
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trapwire-everything-you-need-to-know-2012-8">http://www.businessinsider.com/trapwire-everything-you-need-to-know-2012-8</a><br />

[http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_08_10/Big-Brother-watching-as-TrapWire-wraps-up-America/][4]<br />
<a href="https://publicintelligence.net/unravelling-trapwire">https://publicintelligence.net/unravelling-trapwire</a><br />
<a href="http://reason.com/blog/2012/08/10/creepy-spying-system-revealed-by-wikilea">http://reason.com/blog/2012/08/10/creepy-spying-system-revealed-by-wikilea</a></p>

<p>And here’s a link to the mirror of the recent Wikileaks email release: <a href="http://mirror2.wikileaks-press.org/gifiles/releasedate/2012-08-09.html">http://mirror2.wikileaks-press.org/gifiles/releasedate/2012-08-09.html</a></p>

<p>Though this has been suspected for a while now, I read the news with a huge sinking feeling. Conspiracy theories always have the virtue of the remote possibility of being wrong. But now with the theory confirmed, it appears that global surveillance has been implemented on a scale and degree much worse than CCTV ever was or could’ve been, with a technology purportedly much more sophisticated than just facial recognition. I fear the genie has escaped the bottle, and it will be impossible to put it back in again.</p>

<p>The technology itself has been created by TrapWire, a company which, according to the leaked emails, supplies both the US government and various companies with surveillance equipment. (Side note: interestingly enough, the technology bears a striking resemblance to a controversial new technology [INDECT][5], apparently in use in the EU since 2009).</p>

<p>TrapWire actually has a [website][6] on which it outlines, on first glance, its [well-intentioned philosophy][7]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most modern critical infrastructure and asset protection programs are focused on improving perimeter security, access control, and incident response. While prudent, these physical security measures are reactive — designed to mitigate the effects of an attack, rather than prevent the incident from occurring in the first place. At TrapWire, we have shown that we can achieve better results, and do so much more cost effectively, by shifting the focus from mitigation to prevention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, preventative measures are both more cost-effective and more effective in general. Actually, I think most folks would agree with this. Considered alone, of course we would like to be able to prevent crimes before they occur.</p>

<p>However, if the tradeoff is living in a state of constant surveillance, I believe the cost to be too great.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I believe any actions to create a state of constant, unwarranted surveillance is directly contradictory to the spirit in which our nation was founded, for what it’s worth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I’m not sure that is worth much in general these days.</p>

<p>I hope that quote [rings familiar][8], because I fear as time marches on, those words will ring less and less familiar, until they are stamped out completely and disappear into the vague memory of the past.</p>

<p>Already I fear that the powers that be are trying to distract us and prevent us from hearing the TrapWire news and making an informed judgement for ourselves.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Wikileaks has been under massive DDoS attacks since the beginning of the month, resulting in their site being inaccessible. In all fairness, these attacks started occurring before the latest email leak on August 9, but there is something undeniably fishy about the timing of the attacks.</p>

<p>There is also something very fishy about the group that’s taken responsibility for the attacks on Wikileaks: a purported new group called AntiLeaks, whose leader released [this statement on August 8][9]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can call me DietPepsi. I am the leader of AntiLeaks. We are not doing this to call attention to ourselves. We are young adults, citizens of the United States of America and are deeply concerned about the recent developments with Julian Assange and his attempt at aslyum in Ecuador.</p>

  <p>Assange is the head of a new breed of terrorist. We are doing this as a protest against his attempt to escape justice into Ecuador. This would be a catalyst for many more like him to rise up in his place. We will not stop and they will not stop us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have the keen ability to spot bad actors while watching movies or TV shows. I also detect some bad acting here, and so do most other folks.</p>

<p>In all, it seems quite Orwellian, and it seems clear that someone doesn’t want us to find out about their Orwellian plots. Perhaps they would’ve attracted less attention if they were more forthcoming and transparent? But now people are rightfully curious as ever.</p>

<p>It’ll be interesting what will become of this, but at this point I’ve become a bit pessimistic. I think this will pass and be forgotten, along with the Occupy Movement and any other glimpse of true hope and true change that could come to this country.</p>

<p>Perhaps all this is leading me back to the stark realization that it is time to follow in the steps of my ancestors and leave my country in search of a new and better one? In search of a better life?</p>
