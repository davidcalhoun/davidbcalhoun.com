    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve seen Casablanca more than a few times, and it’s become one of my favorite films.  For this review I got to experience it in 35mm at the wonderful nearby Stanford Theatre.</p>

<p>But that’s not how I first experienced it.  I first watched it at home and half paid attention to it.  A lot of the movie was lost on me and I thought it was overrated, just ok, and not that great.  My views have changed, in case you haven’t guessed.</p>

<p>It does seem to be a film that takes repeated viewings to “get”.  The script is brilliant, every line has its place.  If you look away for a few scenes you may miss some clever back and forth that’s worth watching again to catch.</p>

<p>The pacing is mostly great and still holds up well for modern audiences.  I struggled to find a scene that I could get up for popcorn for.  Every scene had classic lines that I didn’t want to miss.</p>

<p>This film is chock full of classic one-liners that have become part of our culture in their own rite really.  It’s through the love of this film that that’s even made possible.</p>
