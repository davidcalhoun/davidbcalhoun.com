    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before setting off on my current trip, I wanted to give myself at least one “photo assignment”: some goal I could aim to accomplish by pretending like I’d been given an assignment by some employer.</p>

<p>This is the first of what I hope will be many.  The assignment here is to try to capture the atmosphere of eastern Kyoto’s traditional streets at night.</p>

<p>A couple of things I had to plan for: Kyoto is a bit far from my hostel in Osaka, so I made sure to make a day trip out of it.  Also, I wanted preferably a somewhat rainy day, which would make the ground more reflective.</p>

<p>One more thing: the more shots during magic hour, the better.  The sky ends up a lot more beautiful that way.</p>

<p>Ok go, let’s have a look at what I ended up with!</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='666'><meta itemprop='height' content='1000'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-1.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-1.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Walking up the path towards Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Walking up the path towards Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Walking uphill through the shops that are just closing, approaching the pagoda.  Not quite magic hour yet.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='666'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-2.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-2.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Vending machines lighting up the path" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Vending machines lighting up the path</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The light the the vending machines is completely blown out.  I took some bracketed shots of this, but I don’t want to deal with the HDR right now… maybe later.</p>

<p>Just a funny note: instead of the RAW file, I actually ended up postprocessing the HDR JPG for this one accidentally.  Took me a while, but I finally corrected my mistake when I was seeing weird artifacts appearing.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='666'><meta itemprop='height' content='981'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-3.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-3.jpg" width="666" height="981" title="Looking down on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Looking down on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>I had a tough time trying to crop this one.  The posters on the right side are interesting and I wanted to zoom in more on them, but couldn’t find a way to make it work.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='666'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-4.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-4.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Hydrangeas on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Hydrangeas on Ninenzaka Street (二年坂)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Some hydrangeas on a wet street.  This is more like it, this is the kinda shot I came here to take!  There really was no one around at this time.  Most of the folks in the area were camped out with tripods to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4mq25f/i_took_a_picture_of_a_quiet_street_at_night_in/">duplicate a shot they had seen on reddit</a> (which I ended up doing later…).</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='666'><meta itemprop='height' content='1000'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-5.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-5.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Street near Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Street near Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to, Yasaka Pagoda) (法観寺五重塔)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Not sure about the composition here, in terms of the balance.  But I liked the design of the window on the left.  Reminded me of something elven, like it came out of the Lord of the Rings.</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='666'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-6.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-6.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Bar Main Higashiyama Kyoto" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Bar Main Higashiyama Kyoto</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Before I took the following shot, a bartender dressed in fancy clothes skurried past to return after his break.  Actually wasn’t so sure about this photo was worth taking when I was here, but it ended up turning out pretty well!</p>

<p>The bluish light cast a nice reflection on the still-wet ground.  Quick, keep snapping pictures before it dries up!</p>

<p><figure itemprop='image' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/ImageObject' class='center'><meta itemprop='width' content='1000'><meta itemprop='height' content='666'><meta itemprop='url' content='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-7.jpg'><img itemprop='contentUrl' src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/2016-06-15-photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night-7.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Shōren-in gate （青蓮院門跡）" ><figcaption itemprop='caption'>Shōren-in gate （青蓮院門跡）</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The ground dried up by the time I made it here…</p>

<p>I remember crowds up people lined up around here at New Year’s 2013, waiting to ring in the New Year by ringing the bell at the nearby Chion-in temple (知恩院).  It was a cold night, and I ended up bailing out of the line after more than an hour of waiting.</p>

<p>This time I revisited on a warm night, with kind of a creepy atmosphere with no one around.  There was just this imposing gate dimly lit, with signs explaining that it’s closed for the day.  If you look closely, you can even see a little security camera up there.</p>

<p>I ended up walking through a LOT of Kyoto late at night this night.  I walked up to the Path of Philosophy and saw a few fireflies on the way.</p>

<p>I eventually went up to Hyakumanben neighborhood, to the delicious Tenkaippin ramen place near where I used to live and go to school..  had delicious “stamina ramen” with kotteri broth with a ton of other folks around 11:30pm, then ended up walking back towards the Kamogawa only to realize that the trains were out of service for the night.</p>

<p>Ended up walking back to my hotel near Kyoto station, but not before passing even more fireflies by the Kamogawa.  Returned to my hotel around 2am or so… this was a fun night, really reminiscint of that first time I quit my job to come live here for the summer.</p>

<p>Where I sometimes wandered around aimlessly at night, thinking what in the world I was doing here.  Never imagined I’d return here five years later to do the exact same thing, to be at the exact same point in life with seemingly no progress made whatsoever.</p>

<p>I came here not without a purpose this time, but it looks like my time here is almost at an end, and I still have no answer.</p>

<p>For better or worse, it’s time to keep wandering.  I will try to take pictures while I keep wandering!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’d been looking for a night like tonight for a long time, when the new moon fell squarely on the weekend.  The only problem: unpredictable weather!</p>

<p>I drive about an hour and a half south on the 101 and then the 25 to head towards the east Pinnacles entrance, which I’d never been at before.  I also chatted with Yuka over LINE for a bit of it, at least until the reception got bad and dropped the call about ten minutes beofre getting to the park.</p>

<p>In any case, I made past the folks camping nearby, to the wide open dirt parking lot.  I rolled down my window, and stuck my head out the window to look up at the sky.  Wait, what sky?  It turned out to be clouds.  100% clouds.</p>

<p>The forecast said it would be partly cloudy, which has sometimes meant 10% clouds whereas other times…  Well, I guess this fell into the “other times” category.</p>

<p>Just proves that you can’t win them all, and you can’t plan everything.  Sometimes you just have to travel a lot and occassionally get lucky.</p>

<p>Like the time the moon was rising straight over the road behind me on the way to my parents’ house in Big Bear, but I didn’t have my camera stuff ready in time.  That would’ve been an awesome shot, but now it’s an awesome memory.</p>

<p>Or the time I drove up Whitney Portal Road to get a shot of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/franksvalli/13234418335">the snow-covered mountains that you could see visibly glowing under the moonlight</a>.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>

<p>Last night I attended an impromptu star party in Yosemite attended by only one person total.  The sky was really clear, and the Milky Way was very easy to see with camera and the eye.</p>

<p>While taking some photos around 3:30am or so, I saw a bright satellite trawl across the sky.  It was quite bright - maybe an Iridium flare?</p>

<p>My eyes started to track it across the sky, but it almost looked like it was dancing instead of advancing steadily.  It was going stop-go but very smoothly.</p>

<p>At this point I should mention that I’d drank much more coffee than I really should have, in preparation for the long drive.  Despite all the coffee I was getting very tired, which made for a bad combination with driving.</p>

<p>I think the dancing of the satellite was due to the effects of the coffee, that or it was just a natural optical illusion.</p>

<p>The satellite went behind some trees, and soon after that I saw a very bright star emerge over the mountains on the other side of the trees.</p>

<p>Must be a UFO!</p>

<p>I looked at the star intently, and could swear I could see it dancing as well, though a bit more stationary.  It was also changing colors - red, blue, white.  Obviously a very patriotic UFO.</p>

<p>My delirium-fueled excitement was pushing me to get out my super telephoto, which is exactly what I did.  Here I with the perfect equipment, tripod, and RAW video capabilities!  A really good UFO video to post to YouTube!</p>

<p>But nope.  Zoomed in on a tripod, it was clear it was a fairly stationary star, only moving progressively with the backdrop of the other stars in Yosemite’s real-life planetarium.</p>

<p>It was clear it was time to head to bed.  Who knows what else I’d start seeing after a while…</p>

<p>Parked somewhere in a gravel parking lot near Camp Curry and slept in my car (whoohoo for being single and getting to save money).</p>

<p>It was around 4am when I was finally getting to sleep.</p>
