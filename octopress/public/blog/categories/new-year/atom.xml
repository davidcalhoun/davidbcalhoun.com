    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the previous two photo posts I wanted to avoid this sort of heavy reflection New Year post.  But its time has finally come and it should be said, no matter how cheesy it may sound.</p>

<p>I have been living these last few years of my life as driftwood.  At least professionally.  I have all the makings of what should make me happy and successfully in my career, but it’s an illusion.  I am an imposter.  I am living a life as professional driftwood.</p>

<p>What I mean is this: previously I was very active in trying to establish my career as a web developer.  I read as much as I could, practiced as much as I could, and constantly tried to learn new things that would make me better.</p>

<p>I am living what society calls a good life, but I don’t know myself what a good life really is.  I’m sure it’s not this.</p>
