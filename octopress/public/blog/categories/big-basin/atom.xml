<p>I really needed to get out of Silicon Valley again and go experience nature, so on Sunday I drove over to my favorite hiking spot, Big Basin.  There’s a $10 fee to get in and park, but it’s worth it considering it’s about the price of a movie and much more rewarding.</p>

<p>I arrived right after the park opened and started my hike to Berry Creek Falls at 8:20am, which is probably the earliest I’ve started there.  Today was a bit difficult because of the recent rains: much of the trail was very muddy, and I found myself stopping a few times to try to work out the best path through the mud.</p>

<p>And yes, I fell down into the mud.  At least three times.</p>

<p>What was maybe more alarming was the fact that on the way to Berry Creek falls there were multiple newly-fallen trees that were blocking the path.  In one case a tree had completely destroyed a bridge, and I had to find a way over or under the tree.  I unded up going over, walking along the slippery log and then working my way to the other side.  I tried making my way down slowly instead of jumping, which was a bad choice - I grabbed onto a piece of the decaying tree, but it broke off and I slid down a bit…</p>

<p>I made it to Berry Creek Falls, where I’d been before a few years back.  There was a lot more water gushing down the falls this time!</p>

<p>I felt up for it, so I decided to continue the hike on the Berry Creek Falls trail, saw a few more waterfalls I’d never seen before, and then met up with the Sunset Trail, which I took back to the park headquarters, making it about a 11 mile loop.  Started at 8:20am, took some breaks and a lunch stop at Golden Cascade Falls, then finally made it back to my car around 2:20pm.</p>

<p>I definitely brought back lots of mud with me!</p>

<p>On Sunday I grabbed two sandwiches at Le Boulanger, and headed for a late hike in Big Basin, which is my favorite place to hike in the area.  The drive from my apartment in Sunnyvale is almost an hour and a half, and the fee to park is $10, but it’s worth it to go and spend time there once and a while.</p>

<p>I’ve found I can usually find parking very easily at the very end of North Escape Road, near the camping area, which ends up being a much more secluded start to the hike.  Starting from there you can immediately cross over the river and then see the site of the Maddock Homestead right across the river.</p>

<p>From there I traveled up north along the Skyline to the Sea trail, pretty much going as far as I could before sunset, when the trails close.  I got back just as it was getting tough to see with the unaided eye.</p>

<p>Along the way I saw a TON of ladybugs um.. how should I say this.. in the process of making a TON more ladybugs.  I didn’t have my macro lens with me, but I’m tempted to go back just for more of these pictures.  I’ve never seen anything like this before!</p>
