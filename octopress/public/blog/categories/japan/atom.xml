<p>(I originally wrote this while sitting in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan)</p>

<p>I’m visiting Japan again, when part of me is constantly thinking I should instead be spending the time and money exploring other parts of the world.</p>

<p>I guess I just find myself coming back to the familiar and (somewhat) comfortable.  I find that I have the same habit when returning to a restaurant, and ordering the same item from the menu each and every time.  This is what I’ve always done at Roger’s, a sandwich place near where I work.  I guess this sounds kind of silly, but Japan is basically my club sandwich, the old standby which I know won’t disappoint.</p>

<p>The trouble with this is getting stuck in a rut. And if you do it too much, you may end up hating that once beloved club sandwich.</p>

<p>Thankfully, much of my previous difficulties with the language barrier have been bridged, which removes much of the frustration when traveling to Japan.</p>

<p>(However, soon after I confidently typed this, I feel like I missed a beat after ordering a second coffee - sounded like she said “osagaishimasu, ne” [a fraud, eh??] with a pause after, where I just responded by blankly staring into space and hoping it was just some typical rhetoric not requiring a reply on my part.  Oops).</p>

<p>Japan is still difficult in many ways, but now it seems most of these troubles stem from spending too much time in big cities and typical tourist destinations, which are especially crowded this time of the year.  It’s been a while since visiting Japan in the spring as a tourist, and I didn’t realize how many tourists there are here now.  Maybe there’s more than there used to be?</p>

<p>Of course this time around I’m not a student, only another tourist, so I’m contributing to the madness.</p>

<p>They are bursting out of public transportation and meandering their way through the typical attractions, and being loud in all their various languages, and staring around wide-eyed at everything, even me.  “Hey look, it’s another foreigner!” their eyes seem to say.  If Japan is your adults’ Disneyland, stare at the salarymen animatronics, not the other tourists!</p>

<p>Gaijin-to-gaijin interaction has always been really strange in Japan, like they indignantly expect something out of you.  People have written entire posts about the subject.  Perhaps I need to set aside a post of my own sometime.  Or maybe I just need to forget about it - it’s not something I have to worry about anymore.  Perhaps I never really had to truly worry about it.</p>

<p>In addition to all the western tourists, there are of course also tons of Japanese tourists from other parts of Japan, coming to enjoy the cherry blossoms.  And like everyone else, they are scrambling to snap billions of photos of the damned blossoms with their selfie-sticks and tablets and random devices.</p>

<blockquote>
"The cherries’ only fault: the crowds that gather when they bloom"
Saigyo, 12th-century poet
</blockquote>

<p>When I returned to Todaiji in Nara to see the Great Buddha, there was of course a big crowd.  I picked this day to finally try my small Glidecam, my new gadget which is great for stabilizing video.</p>

<p>Eventually I just had to sit down on one of the benches in the Great Buddha Hall and realize I was just contributing to the cameras and all the madness.  Though it was difficult to concentrate, I had to sit there for a while with my thoughts.  Something in me has changed.  All this feels different.  The childlike wonder of this place was somehow gone from me.  It’s the last feeling I wanted to feel.</p>

<p>I spent the next two days in my hotel room in Shin-Osaka.  Maybe it was depression or exhaustion, I don’t know.  I didn’t feel comfortable doing anything or interacting with anyone.</p>

<p>Last night I finally left the room and went out to a local bar to get some pizza, some comfort food I guess.  The bartenders were more than gracious and had good friendly personalities.  Good warm Osaka personalities, definitely not the image of a typical Japanese person in Tokyo.  And more genuinely friendly than any server I’d talked to in the Bay Area (except for a great lady serving at the Ahwahnee restaurant in Yosemite).</p>

<p>Today I finally got to abuse my JR Pass.  And by abuse I mean ride it one only one stop.  I stayed at Shin-Osaka station, so I was able to hop on the Shinkansen into Kyoto (~15 minutes), then take the subway a few stops and walk to Rhinebeck Cafe from there (the cafe is definitely not easily accessible).</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0309-david-calhoun.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Coffee at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Coffee at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It’s a great Kyoto cafe hidden away in an old neighborhood with narrow streets with blind intersections that even persuade normally dauntless taxis to be cautious.</p>

<p>The cafe seems a strange combination: a pancake house inside of an old machiya.</p>

<p>Pancakes?  Machiya?</p>

<p>Pancakes need no explanation, although I should mention they’ve gotten popular inside Japan in the last few years (I’ve also read that the average weight of Japanese people is increasing…).</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0273-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Pancake menu at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Pancake menu at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Machiya?  Ok, that needs a bit of explanation.  A machiya is basically an old traditional Japanese house.  Wooden.  Not modern.  With all sorts of special refined Japanese words for all the various parts of the house, I’m certain.</p>

<p>With modern pancakes inside a traditional machiya, in a way this cafe is a perfect representation of Kyoto: a city with one foot in the past and one foot trying to advance into the future.</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0278-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Eat Desert First at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Eat Desert First at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0279-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Couch and table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Couch and table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The space is small but comfortable, with a small traditional garden outside in a courtyard which leads to the bathrooms.  Even after you order you are still taking in the atmosphere.  Then you realize you are breathing some of it: you can distinctly smell the wood ceiling and beams holding it all together.</p>

<p>I’m disappointed because my camera will pick up sights and even sounds, but there’s no way to capture the nice relaxing wood fragrance here.</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0280-david-calhoun.jpg" width="1000" height="666" title="Notepad and pen at the table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Notepad and pen at the table at Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>There’s a small notepad with a pen on each table, where customers can doodle and leave messages.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of art students in Kyoto, so the little notepads are inevitably filled with strange creatures recently emerged from their creators’ brain.</p>

<p><figure class='center'><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/2015-04-rhinebeck-cafe-kyoto-japan-5D__0313-david-calhoun.jpg" width="666" height="1000" title="Drawings on a notepad in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)" ><figcaption>Drawings on a notepad in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>And suddenly, a temporary disturbance…</p>

<p>A truck goes by, blasting its message through a loudspeaker into the streets and through the thin walls of the cafe.  It’s election time in Japan.  And you’re forced to hear it for a minute or so until it passes by.  I hope they outlaw those trucks someday.</p>

<p>In any case, this is basically the Japan I love.  The warm and uncrowded cafe.</p>

<p>No matter how beautiful the sakura are outside, I’d rather spend my hours here.</p>

<p>Japan has a healthy fascination with the beauty of nature, and this includes the ephemeral cherry blossoms. And one of the prime locations for cherry blossoms is Kyoto, Japan.</p>

<p>It takes a while to realize, but there actually seems to be a wide variety of cherry blossoms which blossom at different times. This stretches the season out a bit (the prime blossoming lasts only about a week). It’s nice to be able to walk around for a few weeks and find random beautiful cherry blossoms.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://library.brown.edu/cds/perry/scroll7_Forkin.html"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/perry-japan-miniature-train-model-train-closeup-1024x684.jpg" alt="Matthew C. Perry and the gift of the miniature train to Japan" width="1024" height="684" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1007" /></a><br />
(view the <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/perry-japan-miniature-train-model-train.jpg">full image</a>, <a href="http://library.brown.edu/cds/perry/scroll7_Forkin.html">image credit</a>)</p>

<p>A long time ago, four black ships appeared off the coast of Japan, which had closed itself off from the world and its influences. These ships were from the US, and commanding them was Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who was instrumental in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_of_Japan">reopening Japan to the rest of the world</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of this, and to promote a goodwill between the two countries, Perry gave various gifts to Japan, one of which was a one-fourth scale model train, in order to convincingly demonstrate the benefit of adopting Western technology:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perry’s gifts aimed to foster trade and good relations between America and Japan by displaying the goodwill of the U.S. as well as its technological and cultural power. This fully operational Norris Works, one-fourth scale model train, complete with 350 feet of 18-gauge track, engine, tender, and car, represented one of these “triumphs of civilization”, which Perry used to influence the Japanese. Behind the Yokohama reception hall, the Americans assembled and operated the locomotive for the Japanese officials, some of whom rode by sitting on top of the car. (<a href="http://library.brown.edu/cds/perry/scroll7_Forkin.html">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course one of the things modern Japan is now famous for is its great rail system, the epitome of which is the world-renowned Shinkansen bullet train.</p>

<p>In contrast, being born and raised in Los Angeles, I’m painfully aware at America’s recent lack of progress in rail transportation, compared to Japan and the rest of the world. Part of this can be blamed on GM and other companies, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy">in the 1930s and 1940s purchased streetcar companies only to dismantle them</a>. It’s the classic tradition of the big corporation buying up the smaller competition in order to stifle it. Unfortunately, as a result of this corporate selfishness, Los Angeles transportation is perhaps permanently handicapped. And currently it’s nearly impossible to live in LA without owning a car. And one of the wonderful benefits of owning a car is of course participating in the great modern innovation known as the traffic jam.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are finally <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gov-brown-defends-high-speed-rail-in-california-2013-1">concrete plans of bringing a bullet train to California</a>, to span Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>

<p>Of course all of this comes decades behind the progress of the rest of the world, and far behind Japan, a country which we were so proud to introduce rail transportation to back in the day.</p>

<p>Perhaps Darth Vader, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuto">his own mask being Japanese-inspired</a>, said it best: “The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.”</p>
