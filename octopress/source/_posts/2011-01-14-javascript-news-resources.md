There&#8217;s an overwhelming amount of information being pumped out of the JavaScript community each week, but how do you keep up with it? Here&#8217;s some sources to keep you busy.

### Twitter

This merits a category of its own. This has replaced the RSS reader for a lot of folks, or at the very least supplemented it.

I&#8217;ve consistently recommended [Nathan Smith&#8217;s list of JavaScript folks][1]. When I&#8217;m diligent, I keep up with this several times a week and [favorite items from the feed][2] to be considered for inclusion in that week&#8217;s [JSMag Blog update][3].

### Aggregators and communities

[Delicious][4]  
[Github][5]  
Reddit: [web_design][6] and [javascript][7]  
[JSMentors][8]

### Blogs

[JavaScript Google Reader bundle][9]  
[JavaScript People Blogs &#8211; Google Reader bundle][10]

[Mozilla articles on hacks.mozilla.org][11]  
[Script Junkie][12]  
[DailyJS][13] &#8211; very frequently updated news by Alex Young  
[QuirksBlog (ppk)][14] &#8211; focus on mobile  
[JavaScript, JavaScript (Angus Croll)][15]  
[John Resig&#8217;s blog][16] &#8211; unfortunately not too active lately (check out [his Twitter][17] for more updated info)  
[Ajaxian][18] &#8211; used to be THE source for news, but it isn&#8217;t updated too much anymore

&#8230;and many more. Check out [Rey Bango&#8217;s &#8220;What to Read to Get Up to Speed in JavaScript&#8221;][19] for more.

### Browser blogs

It&#8217;s important to know what&#8217;s going down in the browser world. These have mixed content, so it&#8217;s not just JavaScript.

[Surfin&#8217; Safari][20]  
[The Chromium Blog][21]  
[The Mozilla Blog][22]

### Weekly news

These sources attempt to do the legwork for you and round up the most important articles each week. (Disclaimer: I currently write for JSMag!)

[JavaScript Weekly][23]: a weekly email newsletter  
[Badass JS][24]  
[JSMag blog][3]

### Podcasts and Videos

[A Minute With Brendan][25]  
[node.minutewith][26]  
[YUI Theatre][27]  
[Node Up][28]
