In [episode 6 of The Big Web Show][1], [Luke Wroblewski][2] gives his &#8220;Mobile First&#8221; talk, explaining his philosophy for designing for mobile, the challenges, and a look at the road ahead. Luke explains that because of the limitations on mobile, developers are forced to really optimize the user experience for mobile. Often times this mobile experience turns out much better than on the desktop, where the &#8220;gluttony of resources&#8221; results in distracting and excessive webpages.
