### What&#8217;s this?

These are some notes I collect as I read through Cameron Moll&#8217;s [Mobile Web Design][1].

### Introduction

8. Further info:

Designing the Mobile User Experience (Barbara Ballard)  
dotMobi Web Developer&#8217;s Guide (dev.mobi)  
Global Authoring Practices for the Mobile Web (Luca Passani) (passani.it/gap)  
Constant Touch: A Global History of the Mobile Web (Jon Agar)  
Personal, Portable, Pedestrian: Mobile Phones in Japanese Life (Mizuko Ito)  
Mobile Interaction Design (Matt Jones)

13. iPhone released just before publication

### Mobile Web Fundamentals

15. [Putting 2.7 Billion in Context: Mobile Phone Users][2]

18. Phone is smaller. Different input methods. Searching for specific data (directions or a phone number) rather than a truckload of data available via the desktop. One handed interaction.

19. Limitations: small screen size, difficulty of data input, user agent inconsistency

Opportunities: location-specific data, on-the-go-messaging, voice communication.

20. Weather Channel &#8211; greater reach on mobile web compared to desktop ([source][3])

21. Rollable display &#8211; Polymer Vision Readius ([video][4])

Many devices and user agents, making testing expensive and impractical. Emulators and testing on multiple devices will lead to successful deployment.

22. Opera Mini &#8211; far better UI than most native browsers

Mostly must be installed manually, except for T-Mobile shipping hundreds of thousands with it pre-installed

23. &#8220;â€¦the mobile web experience is often a small screen, intermittent, one-handed experience&#8221;

24. understanding of target audience, their usage and what they want, and the contextual relevance (phone numbers, etc.) of data

25. Initiate a phone call: wtai scheme for WML, tel scheme for HTML.

Some browsers (Opera Mini, Safari Mobile) automatically convert links to phone numbers

WML scheme to add a number to the address book: wtai://wp/ap;+5555555;Amy%20Miller

26. carrier myopia: devs thinking the only way to reach the audience is by landing on the carrier deck. Mobile User Experience Conference (MEX) 2007: &#8220;Tearing down the walled garden will enhance the mobile content experience and release value for the industry. The objective should be a free market for content and applications, based on open standards and accessible to all. We think the current fragmentation of formats and channels to market is holding back growth.&#8221;

29. &#8220;cell phone&#8221; is an outdated term. Use &#8220;mobile&#8221; or &#8220;device&#8221;.

30. Japanese market: &#8220;keitai&#8221; (=&#8221;something you carry with you&#8221;)

### Four Methods, Revisited

31. [Mobile Web Design ~ The Series][5] (Cameron Moll, 2005)

32. Method 1: Do nothing. If the markup is meaningful and standards-based, the better mobile browsers can adapt.

33. Good browsers such as the iPhone&#8217;s allow the viewing of the full site (with zooming).

34. Advantages: mobile browsers shoulder the burden of reformatting content, no additional effort needed, users have same content and possibly the same experience as on a PC

Disadvantages: doesn&#8217;t address contextual relevance or exploit device capabilities, users with zoom-enabled devices are a small market share

35. Method 2: Reduce images and styling

-presentation styling and images reduced on the fly

mowser.com (Russell Beattie, formerly Yahoo! Mobile)  
skweezer.net &#8211; an older service dating back to 2001

2-minute mobile mod: <http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/07/make-your-site-mobile-friendly>

36. Advantages: relies on implied hierarchy in HTML markup, viewable by a variety of devices, faster download, many browsers override CSS anyway, so why bother?

Disadvantages: ignores contextual relevance of mobility, file size may still be excessive

Method 3: Use Handheld Style Sheets

37. media=&#8221;handheld&#8221; style sheet

38. Not widely supported.

Advantages: handheld style sheet is built into CSS, at most one extra style sheet, one web address  
Disadvantages: ignores contextual relevance of mobility, media=&#8221;handheld&#8221; support is inconsistent and nearly unreliable

Method 4: Create Mobile-Optimized Content

39. Kayak.com/moby

41. Advantages: contextually relevant (addresses first how the content is consumed, and presentation secondly), pages are leaner

Disadvantages: denies access to content by making assumptions about the user and device, two sets of files, alternate web addresses

42. Author&#8217;s opinion: doing nothing and mobile-optimized content are the two viable approaches

### XHTML/CSS Development

43. WML deck and card metaphor. Decline giving way to XHTML. WAP protocol, WML language.

44. With WAP 2.0, XHTML-MP is the preferred markup language

45. [Markup Test Pages][6], [Mobile Web Design: Tips &#038; Techniques (2005)][7]

47. No need to define new standards just for the web. Same regardless of device: &#8220;The underlying standards for the greater web, regardless of device, person, or place, are the same: semantic markup, separation of structure and presentation, accessibility, and so on.&#8221;

[W3C Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0][8]

[Global Authoring Practices for the Mobile Web (Luca Passani)][9]

48. XHTML-MP template

<pre name="code" class="HTML">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 1.0//EN" "http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/xhtml-mobile10.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Site Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mobile.css"/&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="max-age=600" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Page Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
