I just came back from [Mobile Monday Silicon Valley: Best Practices for Mobile Design][2] at the [Computer History Museum][3] in Mountain View. This was a panel discussion with representatives from Google, Microsoft, Nokia, RIM, and Punchcut. There were quite a few little nuggets of wisdom which I tried to write down in bullet form:

#### Sue Booker, UED (Nokia)

*   1 trillion revenue worldwide from disabled users. 60m disabled users in the US.
*   assume the user is multitasking
*   apps will be used in totally unexpected ways
*   not just physical disabilities.. also people in different situations or environmental limitations (no voice, no audio, limited bandwidth, etc)
*   introduce new complicated functionality gradually. It&#8217;s easy to tell if it&#8217;s a new user or a repeat user, so slowly give repeat users more info.
*   final takeaway: think of all types of users

#### Chris Nesladek, Commerce UI Lead (Google)

*   1. keep it simple
*   2. content is king
*   3. make it fun
*   4. make it fast
*   5. do one thing as an experiment
*   new UI challenge in the future: flexible screens?
*   discoverability of new features&#8230; for an Android feature: link to video demo on vimeo
*   final takeaway: designers, make friends with developers, because that&#8217;s how the best products get made

#### Anne Sullivan, UI Designer (Microsoft/Tellme Networks)

*   her focus: designing for speech on mobile
*   problem: discoverability of speech
*   understand the capabilities and limitations of speech
*   graceful degradation for speech: what happens when a voice command isn&#8217;t recognized?
*   be transparent about what happens about processing in the background. For instance, geolocation. Allow the user to change or override this info.
*   paper prototypes are very helpful
*   discoverability of voice command activation is hard.. have to test on device itself (i.e. to find the right button placement, etc.)
*   final takeaway: forget powerpoint! do presentations on the phone itself

#### [Jared Benson][4], Design (Punchcut)

*   iterate quickly
*   no substitute for device itself
*   final takeaway: involve designers from the beginning

#### [Wesley Yun][5], UX (RIM)

*   don&#8217;t make assumptions about touch interfaces (common gestures). The touchscreen is still pretty new, so not everyone is used to this yet
*   don&#8217;t be too clever for your users. Think of users first, and do what makes sense.
*   prototype and fail quickly. If you&#8217;re not failing, you&#8217;re not innovating
*   make sure unusual new interaction isn&#8217;t a core functionality (for instance, four-fingered scroll)
*   if you make something redundant, you&#8217;ve failed as a designer
*   final takeaway: make it obvious to users
