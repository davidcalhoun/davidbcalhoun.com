Lately I&#8217;ve come to terms with the fact I need to try something new in my life &#8211; a true change in direction. I anticipate that this blog will take the same direction, so there will likely be less and less &#8220;developer&#8221; posts and more and more posts of me living this new path. (TLDR: unsubscribe now, probably!)

Why the change in direction? I&#8217;ve had my fun, I&#8217;ve lived a comfortable life where I really haven&#8217;t had to worry about money (yet), but I&#8217;ve learned the hard way that buying &#8220;stuff&#8221; doesn&#8217;t buy happiness. It&#8217;s trite and it&#8217;s something you always hear, but I guess it&#8217;s something you have to figure out for yourself, the hard way. I read Walden in high school and thought I&#8217;d learned from its lessons. But I re-read it recently and came away completely changed. I can get by with a lot less, and most importantly &#8211; with a more meaningful job that pays much less.

I&#8217;ve worked at a few big companies and become a somewhat competent (and surely incompetent in some ways) frontend web developer. It&#8217;s a great way to grow right out of college and a really comfortable way to live out on your own for a little while. It&#8217;s probably a way to continue making a living while supporting a family, but that hasn&#8217;t happened to me yet.

And in any case, it&#8217;s not for me.

At the end of the day I can&#8217;t really say I&#8217;ve made a real difference in the world. I can work as hard as I can, but at the end of the day I&#8217;m just making websites for entertainment. Which is not to say there aren&#8217;t good causes out there, I suppose. And it&#8217;s not to say I can&#8217;t funnel some of this money into good causes, which I&#8217;m been forcing myself to do more and more in very small ways (I seem to be a naturally selfish person, but I&#8217;m trying to get better in that respect). But I can&#8217;t get past the feeling that my time can be better spent.

Now&#8217;s a fantastic time for web development, with so many opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and so many opportunities to publish new findings and pioneer new methods. There will be trailblazers and figureheads, and people making an awesome use of technology. But it won&#8217;t be me. I&#8217;m taking steps to make sure of that.

At one time I viewed my web development skill as simply a means to an end &#8211; and only within the past few years has it been considered what philosophers would call &#8220;an end in itself&#8221;. I picked up this hammer to learn how to build. For a few years I joined the company of some of the best hammersmiths in the world. I even attended hammersmith conferences. But now I&#8217;m resting this hammer down for a little bit of a rest.
