Hello friends!  It's been a while without an update.

I've been working more and more on my photography endeavors, which includes building up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg5jVvaChTjkL74IQ334FzQ">YouTube channel</a> to document my travels and also my learnings.  I'm hoping it's interesting and useful enough, especially for other aspiring photographers.

This year is definitely shaping up to be a year of travelling, and I'd also like to keep a blog of photos and such, so I'm working to get a separate photography blog setup at <a href="https://davidcalhounphotography.com">my photography website</a>.  I'm hoping to get that up soon, as I'm already falling behind!  And I have a trip to Japan coming up next week already!

Anyhow, here's a few recent videos you can check out.

From my recent trip to Edinburgh.  I didn't take much video footage, but was able to put together a quick video with what I had.

Big Bear Lake in the snow.  Just the tail end of the winter season, so I had to take advantage and get out a bit!

Right now my channel is in its very humble beginnings, but I'm still working on getting good content there, and learning to edit my videos better and better as I progress.  Turns out I'm learning photography and a bit of videography and editing as well!  

Please check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg5jVvaChTjkL74IQ334FzQ">my channel</a> and subscribe!  I promise a TON more adventures just in the coming year.  Here's what's already booked:

* Japan (March)
* Atlanta (April)
* Yosemite, Sequoia, Crater Lake road trip with Mark (May)
* Copenhagen and Norway (May/June)
* New Orleans (July)
