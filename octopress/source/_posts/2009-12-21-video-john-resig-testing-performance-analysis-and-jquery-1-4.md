In case you hadn&#8217;t seen it yet, [John Resig][1] was kind enough to stop by Yahoo! for the December [Bayjax][2] meetup. Here&#8217;s the [video][3]:

<div class="video" style="width:576px; height: 324px;">
</div>

Usually developers are more interested in just getting the dang code to work, and as a result actual the testing and maintenance of JavaScript isn&#8217;t talked about too much, so I&#8217;m sure this will be new territory for many developers. And since it&#8217;s John Resig speaking, there was of course a bit about using [TestSwarm][4], a testing distributed framework-agnostic automated testing tool (that&#8217;s a mouthful!).

Included in the talk are good things to note while testing, such as the fact unless you&#8217;re running Firefox or Chrome on Windows, all test times have a margin of error of up to 15ms (not to be confused with [PPK&#8217;s observation of the delay between JavaScript computation and browser rendering][5]).
