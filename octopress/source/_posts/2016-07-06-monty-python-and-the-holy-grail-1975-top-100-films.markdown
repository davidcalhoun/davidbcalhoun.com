This is a movie in the same spirit as the Marx Brothers’ Duck Soup: essentially a string of crazy anarchic skits held together weakly by some central theme.  The story isn't strong, but it doesn't pretend to be and it really doesn't need to be.  It's just there as a sort of skeleton to hang all the skits on.

As a movie, this feels to me to be strangely out of place in the top 100 movies, maybe because it's such a low budget production.  But being low budget is also part of its charm and humor.  It fits easily into the top 100 *comedy* movies of all time however.

I remember getting introduced to the movie by my high school philosophy teacher, who described Monty Python as funny, but sometimes too silly.  And the humor sometimes inpenetrably British.

The movie follows the adventures of King Arthur (Graham Chapman) in his quest for the Holy Grail.
