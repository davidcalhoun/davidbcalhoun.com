<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what happens when your interface completely relies on JavaScript. There&#8217;s code with translated <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake'>mojibake</a> of some sort which caused the JavaScript to break. The code wasn&#8217;t in a try-catch block, so it caused all of the code on the page to fail, thus presenting me with the only part of the screen that wasn&#8217;t generated by JavaScript: the completely useless header.</p>
