<p>This is just a fun little <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW2IXHBPOIo'>video demo</a> into the inner workings of today&#8217;s Google Doodle. Nothing you can&#8217;t do yourself with Firebug or Web Inspector (built into WebKit browsers such as Safari and Chrome). But I liked this doodle so much, I wanted to talk about it!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I know the difference between HTML5 and CSS3, but I&#8217;m not much one for pedantic nomenclature (however, I am apparently supportive of pedantic words like nomenclature). For the purposes of this video, webkit transforms and transitions are part of HTML5.</p>

<p>EDIT: Apparently I missed that the doodle has accelerometer support for devices that support it! Confirmed that it works on my MacBook Pro in Chrome.</p>
