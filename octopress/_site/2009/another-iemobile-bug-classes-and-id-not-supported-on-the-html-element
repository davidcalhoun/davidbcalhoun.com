<p>As it turns out, IEMobile 6/7 (and presumably anything earlier) doesn&#8217;t support classes and ids that are attached to the HTML element. I confirmed this on both IEMobile 6 and 7. Fortunately it looks to be fixed in IEMobile 8 (which makes sense, since it works fine in desktop IE6, which it&#8217;s based on).</p>

<p>The consequence of this is that adding an id/class to the html tag will result in the style not being applied to the document:</p>
<pre class='html' name='code'>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html id="a" class="b"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;Cascade test&lt;/title&gt;
	
	&lt;style type="text/css" media="screen"&gt;
		#a span { color: red; }     /* style isn't applied in IEMobile 6/7 */
		.b span { color: yellow; }  /* style isn't applied in IEMobile 6/7 */
	&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Testing 123&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
