<p>You&#8217;re probably used to typical variables names such as the following:</p>
<pre class='JScript' name='code'>var personName = 'Joe';</pre>
<p>You may not realize it, but there are some non-alphanumeric variables at your disposal.</p>

<h3 id='using_'>Using $</h3>

<p>For instance, the $ variable has been made popular by several JavaScript libraries, most notably <a href='http://jquery.com/'>jQuery</a>. You can use it to alias operations that are commonly performed, such as the following (1):</p>
<pre class='JScript' name='code'>var $ = document.getElementById;
var myElement = $('targetElement');</pre>
<p>If you declare this variable outside of a function it will be a global variable and will compete with libraries that use the same global variable, so it&#8217;s probably best not to use it.</p>

<p>Interestingly, originally the dollar sign $ was originally intended for &#8220;mechanically generated code&#8221; (2), but as the usage of the symbol has become popular for other purposes, it looks like <a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm'>the latest version of JavaScript (ECMAScript 5th edition) now officially &#8220;oks&#8221; its use</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This standard specifies specific character additions: The dollar sign ($) and the underscore (_) are permitted anywhere in an IdentifierName.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id='using_'>Using $$</h3>

<p>Some have come up with the solution of simply using two or more $$ symbols in order to distinguish the variable from libraries that just use a single $:</p>
<pre class='JScript' name='code'>var $$ = document.getElementById;
var myElement = $$('targetElement');</pre>
<h3 id='using__'>Using _</h3>

<p>You will find that you can use the underscore _ in the same way to alias variables and functions:</p>
<pre class='JScript' name='code'>var _ = document.getElementById;
var myElement = _('targetElement');</pre>
<h3 id='other_symbols'>Other symbols</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re really getting adventurous, you can even try using other symbols such as square root √, which seems to work just fine, just as $ and _ above. The only problem: it&#8217;s quite inconvenient using it, since it&#8217;s not available on any keyboards (except through some crazy key combinations perhaps).</p>

<p>Or you can put the symbol to use doing what you would naturally think it should do&#8230;</p>
<pre class='JScript' name='code'>var √ = Math.sqrt;
alert(√(4));   // 2</pre>
