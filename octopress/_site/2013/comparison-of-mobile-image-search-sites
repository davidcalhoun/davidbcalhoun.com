<p>The other day I glanced at a classmate using <a href='http://www.baidu.com/'>Baidu</a> to perform an image search and was impressed with their presentation:</p>

<p><a href='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baidu-mobile-image-search.jpg'><img alt='Baidu mobile image search' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1163' height='480' src='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baidu-mobile-image-search.jpg' width='320' /></a></p>

<p>Note the nice big images and the lack of margins around images. After seeing this presentation, I realized that the common approach of adding margins around images is pretty unnecessary.</p>

<p>I also noticed that the images are a variety of sizes, leading to a less sterile experience. There&#8217;s surely some clever math going on behind the scenes here to make sure the images appear &#8220;justified&#8221; (to use a word from the recent Flickr redesign).</p>

<h3 id='google'>Google</h3>

<p><a href='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-mobile-image-search.jpg'><img alt='Google mobile image search' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1166' height='480' src='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-mobile-image-search.jpg' width='320' /></a></p>

<p>Note the smaller photos, which sometimes causes features on images to be indiscernable.</p>

<p>Also note the more common approach of adding margins around the images. This seems to remove a lot of space which could otherwise be used to show more details of images, which is the approach Baidu takes.</p>

<h3 id='bing'>Bing</h3>

<p><a href='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bing-mobile-image-search.jpg'><img alt='Bing mobile image search' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1169' height='480' src='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bing-mobile-image-search.jpg' width='320' /></a></p>

<p>Bing uses a nicely-designed slick interface with a black background, which I tend to like a bit better.</p>

<p>However, all its images are cropped or resized to be exactly the same size, leading to a more sterile gridlike experience.</p>

<p>Also, just a minor complaint, but the search magnifying glass appears to be a tiny bit blurry, especially compared to the sharpness of the Bing logo. But it&#8217;s barely noticeable, especially compared to Yahoo (below).</p>

<h3 id='yahoo'>Yahoo!</h3>

<p><a href='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yahoo-mobile-image-search.jpg'><img alt='Yahoo mobile image search' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1167' height='480' src='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yahoo-mobile-image-search.jpg' width='320' /></a></p>

<p>Yahoo has nice big images, actually a bit too big. Bit it also appears to suffer from the approach Bing uses to resize photos to make their dimensions exactly the same.</p>

<p>Again note the common white margins around the images.</p>

<p>The non-retina top graphics (logo and search button) are so blurry and distracting that I have to at least mention them here. These images look blurry on every modern phone on the market today, and it&#8217;s sad to me that neither developers nor QA cared enough about this to do something about it.</p>

<p>Strangely, these images look fine on the main &#8220;Web&#8221; tab, but they are distractingly blurry on this Images view as well as others.</p>

<h3 id='flickr_mobile_app_ios'>Flickr mobile app (iOS)</h3>

<p><a href='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-app-image-search.jpg'><img alt='Flickr mobile app image search' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1164' height='480' src='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-app-image-search.jpg' width='320' /></a></p>

<p>The Flickr app itself has some decently-sized images, but here again we see the image margins at work. This is also present on the &#8220;justified view&#8221; on the desktop site, so I suppose they wanted to be consistent.</p>

<h3 id='flickr_mobile_web'>Flickr mobile web</h3>

<p><a href='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-web-image-search.jpg'><img alt='Flickr mobile web image search' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1165' height='480' src='http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/flickr-mobile-web-image-search.jpg' width='320' /></a></p>

<p>This is certainly the worst out of the bunch. It&#8217;s a real waste of space, with small images sacrificed for textual information that&#8217;s a little excessive for this screen.</p>

<p>I think this is just due to the website&#8217;s age. Flickr&#8217;s mobile website is much neglected and is showing its age. I would be really nice to see updates to match the nice progress they&#8217;ve made with the &#8220;justified layout&#8221; that you can see on their desktop site and mobile app.</p>
