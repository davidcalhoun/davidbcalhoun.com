<p>After work today, I stopped by the old bustling Apple Store in Palo Alto. I was there for a bit of a peek at what my next blank check to Apple would bring me.</p>

<p>I was between tables going back and forth between the updated MacBook Pro (non-retina) and the Retina MacBook Pro and came away with some initial impressions. I couldn&#8217;t find these sort of &#8220;impartial&#8221; impressions elsewhere, so I thought I&#8217;d record these impressions for myself.</p>

<h3 id='prima_facie'>Prima facie</h3>

<p>Initial thoughts: the screen seemed to be slightly more crisp, especially the icons in the dock. However, the form factor made more of an impression than the screen: the laptop is significantly lighter than previous models I&#8217;ve used (for the record, I use a late 2008 MBP at home, and have been using newer MacBook Pros for work purposes). I picked up the laptop expecting it to be nearly as heavy as what I&#8217;m used to, and overcompensated when lifting it up. That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>

<p>The lady at the store opened up iPhoto and showed me a few photos. It seemed to be crisper, but nothing like the noticeable difference when I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS to an iPhone 4S. She also opened up the Apple homepage on the Retina display and on a non-Retina, and pointed out a specific piece of text. In this case it was text in a graphic. We had to shuffle back and forth in order to be convinced. In this case we were actually looking at the text on a graphic on the Apple site):</p>

<h3 id='good_for_photo_editing'>Good for photo editing?</h3>

<p>The differences in the text and dock icons was easier to see than the difference between photos in iPhoto. As an amateur photographer, I&#8217;m unsure if this makes a difference. When editing photos, instead of zooming my head closer to the screen I end up leaving my head stationary and zooming with controls in the photo editing program I use. The Retina screen makes the experience a bit nicer, but obviously isn&#8217;t a requirement for producing good detailed photos. For photographers, I think there&#8217;s an apt analogy. The Retina screen is kind of like an expensive lens: it definitely help, but it won&#8217;t guarantee good photos, and not all good photos are necessarily taken with good lenses.</p>

<h3 id='application_support_or_lack_thereof'>Application support (or lack thereof)</h3>

<p>One thing that was also evident is that not everything is ready for the Retina screen. Photoshop surprisingly didn&#8217;t support it, even though the saleslady mentioned they had an early look at the Retina MacBook Pro. Surprisingly, not even the Apple Store greeting/icons on the demo mode laptops was ready for the screen (it was visibly pixelated).</p>

<p>The guy next to me predictably loaded up Microsoft Word and complained about it looking ugly (apparently he got the memo and wanted to act surprised). Like other programs, it&#8217;s just a matter of time until they fix it. Whatever, I can deal with that.</p>

<p>I tried to load up YouTube in Safari, but I didn&#8217;t have a good 1080p video to test (for the record, I tried this one, which doesn&#8217;t look too great at 1080p: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjC72RIDt_A'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjC72RIDt_A</a>). I&#8217;ll have to try again later.</p>

<h3 id='testing_out_different_viewing_distances'>Testing out different viewing distances</h3>

<p>Lastly, I tried several viewing distance tests. I found that at my normal viewing distance (sorry I don&#8217;t have measurements) I could definitely tell that things were a little sharper, but again, the difference was slight. As I moved back, it didn&#8217;t take long for the difference to be indiscernible compared to the non-Retina screen. Starting again from normal viewing distance, the closer I got, the easier it was to tell that it was a &#8220;Retina&#8221; screen. In my mind, there&#8217;s a logical reason &#8220;Retina&#8221; came first to the iPhone, then the iPad, and now the MacBook Pro, in that order. It simply becomes less discernable at longer viewing distances.</p>

<h3 id='afterthoughts_impact_on_web_development'>Afterthoughts: impact on web development?</h3>

<p>At least on my initial impression, it didn&#8217;t seem that the new Retina screen necessitated too much of a change in websites offering higher-resolution graphics. They can get along just fine not upgrading, but I suppose folks will enjoy high-res graphics when they see it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s now been a few years after the iPhone 4 was released, and years since high pixel density Android phones have been on the market, and I still still see noticeably blurry graphics on mobile sites. Hopefully at the greater viewing distance afforded by the MacBook Pro, there will be less of a shock at seeing the contrast between sharp text and a blurry photo. Perhaps a laptop is a nice compromise: good enough to enjoy &#8220;Retina&#8221; graphics where supported, but not too distracting when graphics aren&#8217;t optimized for the high pixel density.</p>

<h3 id='tldr_too_long_didnt_read'>TLDR (Too long, didn&#8217;t read)</h3>

<p>TLDR/Conclusion: the light form factor was more of a sell for me than the Retina screen. Though the Retina screen is nice, it&#8217;s hard to justify the purchase on that alone. However, the purchase becomes justified when coupled with a nice processor bump and nice form factor. Since I&#8217;ve been waiting to upgrade for a while, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before I get one. But as I don&#8217;t NEED one yet, I&#8217;ll wait until prices drop a bit (as they always do).</p>
