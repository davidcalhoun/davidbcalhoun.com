<h3 id='thoughts'>Thoughts</h3>

<p>After running these SunSpider tests, it looks like overall there&#8217;s significant speed gains between iOS 3.1.3 and iOS 4 GM. However, it&#8217;s concerning from these tests there were some things that actually ran <em>slower</em> on iOS 4. This either represents a real speed loss between the versions, a margin of error, or some flaw or inconsistency while testing. Or maybe I possibly have some wrong setting on my phone? Any input would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Device: iPhone 3GS</p>

<p>The test was run five separate times on the same phone for each version of the OS. The phone was completely turned off and on before each test.</p>

<p>The most extreme values of the five tests were thrown out, and the resulting four tests were averaged (sometimes from three tests when the values were very close together). I&#8217;m no statistics expert, so if you&#8217;d like to work it out for yourself, here are my raw test results:</p>
