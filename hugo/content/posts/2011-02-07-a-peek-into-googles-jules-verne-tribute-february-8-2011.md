This is just a fun little [video demo][1] into the inner workings of today's Google Doodle. Nothing you can't do yourself with Firebug or Web Inspector (built into WebKit browsers such as Safari and Chrome). But I liked this doodle so much, I wanted to talk about it!

Disclaimer: I know the difference between HTML5 and CSS3, but I'm not much one for pedantic nomenclature (however, I am apparently supportive of pedantic words like nomenclature). For the purposes of this video, webkit transforms and transitions are part of HTML5.

EDIT: Apparently I missed that the doodle has accelerometer support for devices that support it! Confirmed that it works on my MacBook Pro in Chrome.
