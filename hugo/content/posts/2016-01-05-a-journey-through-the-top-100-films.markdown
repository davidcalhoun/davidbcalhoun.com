It's the beginning of January, which means the beginning of a new year.  And you know what that means - a time for making resolutions that will probably not be kept!  Well, let's see how far this one goes...

Instead of wasting away my time playing video games, I've decided to take a bit more seriously another passion: watching movies.  I'm going to try to make this constructive by reviewing each of the top 100 movies, many of which I'll be sitting down and watching for the very first time, and many of which are old favorites that I'll be rewatching, unfortunately not with fresh eyes.

This should be completely doable, as this comes out to watching roughly 2 movies a week.  The part I expect to be time-consuming are the reviews for each film, which I want to be worthwhile to read, with screenshots and such, to keep the readers' eyes stimulated between the walls of text I'm sure to write.

## Selecting the 100
My method for selecting the top 100 movies is to take the unweighted [highest rated films on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?count=100&groups=top_250&sort=user_rating) and filter out anything from the last 15 years, meaning that all of these films will be pre-2000.

This may seem pretty arbitrary to some folks, but if you've watched the IMDB rankings for any period of time you'll notice new movies have a tendency to show up high in the rankings for a brief period before falling lower over time.  My guess here is that time is a sort of sieve, and as such it takes time for the sieve to filter these newer movies.  But I can sort of speed up that process by jumping back 15 years (because 2000 is a nice round number), to movies that the sieve has had time to work on.

The more recent films are also in our more recent collective conscious - you can see this reflected in the distribution of films by decade below.

Also, this somewhat avoids the type of film rankings where Citizen Kane always shows up as #1, and most of the pre-1980 classics seem to have strong preference over anything recent.  

## Some Quick Statistics
* only 27 films not previously watched before
* only one film not on Blu Ray: Sholay (1975)
* average running time: 130 minutes (2 hours 10 minutes)
