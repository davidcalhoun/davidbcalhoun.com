These damn existential nights are the worst.

I'm tired of wasting my nights distracting myself, so I stayed at work late and went to the gym even later, then left around 10:45pm.

Even while exercising I could feel me asking myself nagging questions.  Why am I working out?  What's the goal?  What's the point of keeping your body healthy if you don't even know where you're going?

These are important questions, but not the right questions when I'm not in the mood.  I thought exercise could keep some depression at bay, but it's still there, and there it reappears at the most inconvenient times.

I'm fighting it.

My body is getting healthier and my mind is getting stronger, and I'm slowly figuring out the path I'm going to take.

Sleep is the best medicine for now.
