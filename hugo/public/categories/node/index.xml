      <description>A while back I had a need for a general timeout option for async.parallel and was surprised I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find much information about how to do it. I was using async.parallel to make a lot of REST calls in parallel, but one of them was getting blocked by a firewall, resulting in an eventual timeout minutes later.
One option was to specify a shorter timeout for each individual REST call, including the one causing the problem.</description>
