      <description>(this is a copy of a letter which I&amp;#8217;ve sent to various representatives in government)
As a concerned citizen, I know you understand that I must occasionally voice my concern through letters such as this. My hope is that you will honestly consider my claims and take action on my part. I honestly appreciate you taking your time to seriously consider this letter.
I&amp;#8217;m writing to you today specifically in response to abuses by the NSA overstepping its bounds.</description>
