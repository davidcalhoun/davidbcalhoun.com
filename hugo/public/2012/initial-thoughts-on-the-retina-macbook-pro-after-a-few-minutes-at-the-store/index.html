    <br> <div class="text-justify">

<p>After work today, I stopped by the old bustling Apple Store in Palo Alto. I was there for a bit of a peek at what my next blank check to Apple would bring me.</p>

<p>I was between tables going back and forth between the updated MacBook Pro (non-retina) and the Retina MacBook Pro and came away with some initial impressions. I couldn&rsquo;t find these sort of &ldquo;impartial&rdquo; impressions elsewhere, so I thought I&rsquo;d record these impressions for myself.</p>

<h3 id="prima-facie">Prima facie</h3>

<p>Initial thoughts: the screen seemed to be slightly more crisp, especially the icons in the dock. However, the form factor made more of an impression than the screen: the laptop is significantly lighter than previous models I&rsquo;ve used (for the record, I use a late 2008 MBP at home, and have been using newer MacBook Pros for work purposes). I picked up the laptop expecting it to be nearly as heavy as what I&rsquo;m used to, and overcompensated when lifting it up. That&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>

<p>The lady at the store opened up iPhoto and showed me a few photos. It seemed to be crisper, but nothing like the noticeable difference when I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS to an iPhone 4S. She also opened up the Apple homepage on the Retina display and on a non-Retina, and pointed out a specific piece of text. In this case it was text in a graphic. We had to shuffle back and forth in order to be convinced. In this case we were actually looking at the text on a graphic on the Apple site):</p>

<p><a href="http://images.apple.com/home/images/macbookpro_title.png"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/non-retina.png" alt="Non-retina text" title="Non-retina text" width="374" height="124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://images.apple.com/home/images/macbookpro_title_2x.png"><img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/retina.png" alt="Retina text" title="Retina text" width="748" height="248" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906" /></a></p>

<p>Non-retina (top) and Retina (bottom) graphics at native resolution.</p>

<p>(technical note: the Retina version is served via JavaScript - see <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/how-apple-com-will-serve-retina-images-to-new-ipads/">http://blog.cloudfour.com/how-apple-com-will-serve-retina-images-to-new-ipads/</a>)</p>

<h3 id="good-for-photo-editing">Good for photo editing?</h3>

<p>The differences in the text and dock icons was easier to see than the difference between photos in iPhoto. As an amateur photographer, I&rsquo;m unsure if this makes a difference. When editing photos, instead of zooming my head closer to the screen I end up leaving my head stationary and zooming with controls in the photo editing program I use. The Retina screen makes the experience a bit nicer, but obviously isn&rsquo;t a requirement for producing good detailed photos. For photographers, I think there&rsquo;s an apt analogy. The Retina screen is kind of like an expensive lens: it definitely help, but it won&rsquo;t guarantee good photos, and not all good photos are necessarily taken with good lenses.</p>

<h3 id="application-support-or-lack-thereof">Application support (or lack thereof)</h3>

<p>One thing that was also evident is that not everything is ready for the Retina screen. Photoshop surprisingly didn&rsquo;t support it, even though the saleslady mentioned they had an early look at the Retina MacBook Pro. Surprisingly, not even the Apple Store greeting/icons on the demo mode laptops was ready for the screen (it was visibly pixelated).</p>

<p>The guy next to me predictably loaded up Microsoft Word and complained about it looking ugly (apparently he got the memo and wanted to act surprised). Like other programs, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time until they fix it. Whatever, I can deal with that.</p>

<p>I tried to load up YouTube in Safari, but I didn&rsquo;t have a good 1080p video to test (for the record, I tried this one, which doesn&rsquo;t look too great at 1080p: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjC72RIDt_A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjC72RIDt_A</a>). I&rsquo;ll have to try again later.</p>

<h3 id="testing-out-different-viewing-distances">Testing out different viewing distances</h3>

<p>Lastly, I tried several viewing distance tests. I found that at my normal viewing distance (sorry I don&rsquo;t have measurements) I could definitely tell that things were a little sharper, but again, the difference was slight. As I moved back, it didn&rsquo;t take long for the difference to be indiscernible compared to the non-Retina screen. Starting again from normal viewing distance, the closer I got, the easier it was to tell that it was a &ldquo;Retina&rdquo; screen. In my mind, there&rsquo;s a logical reason &ldquo;Retina&rdquo; came first to the iPhone, then the iPad, and now the MacBook Pro, in that order. It simply becomes less discernable at longer viewing distances.</p>

<h3 id="afterthoughts-impact-on-web-development">Afterthoughts: impact on web development?</h3>

<p>At least on my initial impression, it didn&rsquo;t seem that the new Retina screen necessitated too much of a change in websites offering higher-resolution graphics. They can get along just fine not upgrading, but I suppose folks will enjoy high-res graphics when they see it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s now been a few years after the iPhone 4 was released, and years since high pixel density Android phones have been on the market, and I still still see noticeably blurry graphics on mobile sites. Hopefully at the greater viewing distance afforded by the MacBook Pro, there will be less of a shock at seeing the contrast between sharp text and a blurry photo. Perhaps a laptop is a nice compromise: good enough to enjoy &ldquo;Retina&rdquo; graphics where supported, but not too distracting when graphics aren&rsquo;t optimized for the high pixel density.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-too-long-didn-t-read">TLDR (Too long, didn&rsquo;t read)</h3>

<p>TLDR/Conclusion: the light form factor was more of a sell for me than the Retina screen. Though the Retina screen is nice, it&rsquo;s hard to justify the purchase on that alone. However, the purchase becomes justified when coupled with a nice processor bump and nice form factor. Since I&rsquo;ve been waiting to upgrade for a while, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before I get one. But as I don&rsquo;t NEED one yet, I&rsquo;ll wait until prices drop a bit (as they always do).</p>
