    <br> <div class="text-justify"><p>This is finally the end of my first week in Japanese language school here in Kyoto. It&rsquo;s been quite a long week, with the most studying I&rsquo;ve ever done in my life. We&rsquo;ve gone through nine chapters in a week, and just Friday received two more books for learning Kanji. We&rsquo;ll learn our first 50 Kanji in a week, alongside the rest of our classes. I already know some words here and there, but for the most part, much of what we&rsquo;ve just learned is a blur, which is forcing me to use almost all of my free time in running to catch up.</p>

<p>Having very little leisure time has been good in some ways. It&rsquo;s been a marked change in the cozy, comfortable lifestyle of sitting in front of a computer screen all day, doing tasks which were somewhat challenging but ultimately not rewarding. Those days in Silicon Valley were ended with a gratuitous amount of free time (which is unusual, working for a startup). Which seems nice for a while, but becomes a bit maddening after long, at least for me.</p>

<p>I remember moving to Silicon Valley and buying my TV and PS3 and everything to set me up with all the comforts of my new lifestyle. After coming home from work, I would waste away my time on my computer, my TV, or my video games. After long it was pretty easy to see the same mundane cycle develop: wake up, work, waste time, sleep. Rinse, repeat. Ad nauseum. Ad absurdum.</p>

<p>It became apparent that this lifestyle wasn&rsquo;t really healthy, mentally or physically. It would be better, I thought, to live in a city where I needed to walk around from place to place, or take public transport. San Francisco is perfect for that, but I gave the city (or should I say &ldquo;The City&rdquo; as folks there do) a shot and it never really grew on me. In my short time here on Earth, I&rsquo;ve found there are other cities that are better suited to me. I wanted to find a city I liked, which ended up being far away Kyoto, where I&rsquo;m at now.</p>

<p>My unhealthy physical lifestyle, combined with too much free time, had resulted in an unhealthy mental state. I believe lack of exercise leads to deteriorated mental performance as well as depression, and this is what I believe I experienced. This combined with too much free time, solitude, and a brooding time resulted in days where I&rsquo;d come home from work and attempt to distract myself by browsing the internet the rest of the day. I ended up absorbing the highly-prized gift of free time which I wasted with abandon, before going asleep and starting the cycle over again.</p>

<p>Now, after becoming a student, I have relearned what it&rsquo;s like to have every little free time. I&rsquo;m stressed out and overwhelmed already (as a beginner Japanese language student), but it feels good in a lot of ways. I feel alive, but I also feel like I&rsquo;m not squandering my free time, or worrying about what I do with the free time I have. In a lot of ways I think I became maddened with the choice, and maddened with brooding in my free time over my life path and the usefulness (to society) of my career choice. Maybe I had chosen the wrong one? I wonder what it would be like if I had chosen to live in Japan after all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both;</p>

<p>Laugh at the world’s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that; laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret both.</p>

<p>Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both.</p>

<p>Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both.</p>

<p>This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy. (Kierkegaard)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage by Kierkegaard gives a lot of insight into the brooding mind of an existentialist, but arguably offers us a glimpse at the modern human predicament. We make choices daily, and we also make great life-changing choices. It&rsquo;s natural to think &ldquo;Would I have been better off if I did it differently? If I choose differently?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Kierkegaard himself, if I remember right, lived off of his family&rsquo;s money and didn&rsquo;t have to worry about work. He had an excessive amount of leisure time, and perhaps that influenced the amount of time he had to brood over his life&rsquo;s choices. He certainly had enough time to write down these thoughts, so I would think that his thoughts themselves were more numerous than his writings.</p>

<p>Since I no longer have too much free time, but rather too little of it, I have that much less time to brood over matters. I have made my choices for now (moving to Japan, studying Japanese full time), and I will only know if I&rsquo;ve made the right decision after spending more time giving this path a try.</p>

<p>This is good in a lot of ways. In a lot of ways, the choice of what to do in my leisure time has been made for me. I must use it to study.</p>

<p>The choice is made! The existentialist dilemma has been, at the very least, temporarily pushed aside.</p>

<p>And at the very best, the existentialist dilemma has been conquered. &ldquo;Live in Japan or do not live in Japan, you will regret it either way&rdquo;. Now I have done both. I&rsquo;ve now lived on both sides of the coin, on both sides of the world.</p>
