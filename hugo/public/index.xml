      <description>When the year&amp;rsquo;s days shorten and their number dwindles, I have liked to sometimes take the initiative to sort through all the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken (with my &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; camera). The eventual goal: to put together a sampling of the photos that stand out, sometimes for technical reasons, and sometimes for other reasons.
This year I sadly didn&amp;rsquo;t get out with the camera as much as I have in previous years, which made this post much easier (no excuses this year!</description>

      <description>Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve been programming for a while, and you&amp;rsquo;re pretty comfortable using for loops to traverse Arrays. However, you know how untidy and complicated for loops can get, and you are interested in better approaches to keep the code clean. Enter map and reduce!
First steps with for loops Most folks find for loops powerful enough to achieve all they need when they need to process items in an Array.</description>

      <description>From Soren Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits&amp;rdquo;
(this excerpt is from Provocations, excerpts from Kierkegaard, Plough)
Once upon a time there was a wood dove. It had its nest in the fearsome forest, where wonder and apprehension dwelt together, among the erect, lonely trees. But nearby, where the smoke rises up from the farmer‚Äùs house, lived some tame doves. The wood dove would often meet a pair of these. He would sit on a branch that stretched out over the farmyard, not far from the two tame doves on the ridge of the roof.</description>

      <title>Stifling Laughter in Distant Places</title>

      <description>New Cultures The first days of traveling usually involves laughing at the quaint and unusual customs of another culture. That sounds close-minded, because in many cases it probably is. But it&amp;rsquo;s something we all do, of course including yours truly. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a coping mechanism - laughing at things in the face of difficulties and differences.
To be fair, we&amp;rsquo;re thinking creatures, and as such it&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard for us not to draw comparisons with our own home city and culture.</description>

      <description>Hello friends! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while without an update.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working more and more on my photography endeavors, which includes building up a YouTube channel to document my travels and also my learnings. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it&amp;rsquo;s interesting and useful enough, especially for other aspiring photographers.
This year is definitely shaping up to be a year of travelling, and I&amp;rsquo;d also like to keep a blog of photos and such, so I&amp;rsquo;m working to get a separate photography blog setup at my photography website.</description>

      <title>Beginning thoughts on the idea of a Great American Road Trip</title>

      <description>The idea of a trip across the United States has become somewhat of an American institution. Something like a New American Dream, this one maybe a bit more accessible than that house, happy life, and nuclear family with 2.5 kids. It&amp;rsquo;s something that is undertaken by both the young and the old, with the former perhaps hitchhiking or sleeping in their cars while the latter leapfrog between National Parks in their expensive and comfortable motor homes.</description>

      <description>A few years back I put together my favorite photos of the year (see it: part one and part two). I decided to resurrect the tradition, and I hope to keep it going in the coming years!
Onto the pics!
February I visited Yosemite twice, first by myself and later with my friend Kevin.
Night sky from Yosemite  For this shot I drove to the empty Bridalveil Falls parking lot and placed an LED lantern in the middle of the parking lot, then shot straight up.</description>

      <description>A few years back I had the opportunity to visit New Orleans in the spring with my friend. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve returned with my parents to visit in the fall!
My mom had recently expressed a desire to do more travelling while still physically able, which kicked off creating a list of places to visit, and ultimately booking this first trip. Hopefully the first of many to come. She asked if I wanted to tag along, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass up another visit to the city.</description>

      <description>Many folks, including yours truly, have had an unpleasant night, and this morning a bitter awakening at the announcement that our new President will be Trump. For most folks this comes as a shock, as we have all thought the chances of this happening were slim. Comedians chided him on and dared him to run. Even President Obama who continually roasted him at the White House Correspondents&amp;rsquo; Dinner in 2011, arguably the defining moment when Trump became driven to run for President (&amp;ldquo;He certainly would bring some change to the White House&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <title>Quine and Heidegger: Against Reductionism</title>

      <description>Earlier this year I had the opportunity to attend my first philosophy class in about a decade. The class was on the infamous philosopher Martin Heidegger, and the course was taught at Stanford University by Forrest Hartman (PHI 98: An Introduction to Martin Heidegger (Spring 2016)).
Heidegger is famous for being obscure and notoriously difficult to read, but I believe I made some headway in what turned out to be a very interesting philosophy.</description>

      <description>We Americans believe we have a right to be the way we want to be, which includes being lazy physically and intellectually. Junk is more shiny and more entertaining than non-junk, after all, and we can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to be bored with non-junk. We now have many forms of poison that we unwittingly ingest in various ways. We have created in many ways our own version of the gladiator games that the masses celebrated through the downfall of Rome.</description>

      <description>Maple leaves at Tofukuji Temple, Kyoto  It&amp;rsquo;s autumn again. The temperatures are dropping up here in the mountains of Big Bear, especially at night, when it&amp;rsquo;s now approaching freezing or below. A surprising number of trees are changing colors. I say surprising because this is California, after all, and we don&amp;rsquo;t usually see fall colors unless we know where to look.
The aspens are of course doing their thing and changing from green to yellow, and there are other surprising splashes of red and orange as I drive through the neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) (Top 100 Films)</title>

      <description>This is a movie in the same spirit as the Marx Brothers‚Äô Duck Soup: essentially a string of crazy anarchic skits held together weakly by some central theme. The story isn&amp;rsquo;t strong, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be and it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be. It&amp;rsquo;s just there as a sort of skeleton to hang all the skits on.
As a movie, this feels to me to be strangely out of place in the top 100 movies, maybe because it&amp;rsquo;s such a low budget production.</description>

      <description>Before setting off on my current trip, I wanted to give myself at least one &amp;ldquo;photo assignment&amp;rdquo;: some goal I could aim to accomplish by pretending like I&amp;rsquo;d been given an assignment by some employer.
This is the first of what I hope will be many. The assignment here is to try to capture the atmosphere of eastern Kyoto&amp;rsquo;s traditional streets at night.
A couple of things I had to plan for: Kyoto is a bit far from my hostel in Osaka, so I made sure to make a day trip out of it.</description>

      <description>The biggest culture shock of Indonesia had to be the bathroom facilities, but that&amp;rsquo;s best saved for another post. The second biggest culture shock had to be the roads, and the drivers on them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to any third world Asian country before, so the idea of seeing roads dominated by scooters and motorcycles was really a foreign concept to me. This also meant that the style of driving is way different.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been here in Japan for a month and in true form haven&amp;rsquo;t provided much in the way of updates since then. Doh.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a catch-up post, with plenty of pictures and videos to keep things interesting.

      <description>GPS track log  See the interactive GPS track log here.
I really needed to get out of Silicon Valley again and go experience nature, so on Sunday I drove over to my favorite hiking spot, Big Basin. There&amp;rsquo;s a $10 fee to get in and park, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it considering it&amp;rsquo;s about the price of a movie and much more rewarding.
I arrived right after the park opened and started my hike to Berry Creek Falls at 8:20am, which is probably the earliest I&amp;rsquo;ve started there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Casablanca more than a few times, and it&amp;rsquo;s become one of my favorite films. For this review I got to experience it in 35mm at the wonderful nearby Stanford Theatre.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not how I first experienced it. I first watched it at home and half paid attention to it. A lot of the movie was lost on me and I thought it was overrated, just ok, and not that great.</description>

      <description>Schindler&#39;s List title card with candles  This is a film that is best experienced, not explained in a post like this. However, that being said, I&amp;rsquo;ll give this a try anyhow.
I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided this film all my life out of dread more than anything. It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat weird then that I watched this so early in my &amp;ldquo;Top 100&amp;rdquo; films quest. I knew I&amp;rsquo;d have to watch it eventually anyhow.</description>

      <description>IKIRU, Áîü„Åç„Çã, TO LIVE  This is an existentialist story about a man who learns he has stomach cancer, leading to his reconsidering of life, which he realizes has been utterly wasted up until this point.
As it turns out, he realizes he hasn&amp;rsquo;t really been living at all. What&amp;rsquo;s inadvertently happened is that his job has turned into his life - the job of being section chief at one of the endless wasteful government bureaucracies.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of January, which means the beginning of a new year. And you know what that means - a time for making resolutions that will probably not be kept! Well, let&amp;rsquo;s see how far this one goes&amp;hellip;
Instead of wasting away my time playing video games, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take a bit more seriously another passion: watching movies. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to make this constructive by reviewing each of the top 100 movies, many of which I&amp;rsquo;ll be sitting down and watching for the very first time, and many of which are old favorites that I&amp;rsquo;ll be rewatching, unfortunately not with fresh eyes.</description>

      <title>Big Basin October Hike</title>

      <description>GPS track log  See the interactive GPS track log here.
On Sunday I grabbed two sandwiches at Le Boulanger, and headed for a late hike in Big Basin, which is my favorite place to hike in the area. The drive from my apartment in Sunnyvale is almost an hour and a half, and the fee to park is $10, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it to go and spend time there once and a while.</description>

      <description>Haleakala sunset   Andre: OK. Yes, we are bored. We&amp;rsquo;re all bored now. But has it ever occurred to you, Wally, that the process that creates this boredom that we see in the world now may very well be a self-perpetuating, unconscious form of brainwashing, created by a world totalitarian government based on money, and that all of this is much more dangerous than one thinks? And it&amp;rsquo;s not just a question of individual survival Wally, but that somebody who&amp;rsquo;s bored is asleep, and somebody who&amp;rsquo;s asleep will not say no?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d been looking for a night like tonight for a long time, when the new moon fell squarely on the weekend. The only problem: unpredictable weather!
I drive about an hour and a half south on the 101 and then the 25 to head towards the east Pinnacles entrance, which I&amp;rsquo;d never been at before. I also chatted with Yuka over LINE for a bit of it, at least until the reception got bad and dropped the call about ten minutes beofre getting to the park.</description>

      <description>Milky Way over the trees, seem from Yosemite Valley around 3am  Last night I attended an impromptu star party in Yosemite attended by only one person total. The sky was really clear, and the Milky Way was very easy to see with camera and the eye.
While taking some photos around 3:30am or so, I saw a bright satellite trawl across the sky. It was quite bright - maybe an Iridium flare?</description>

The first day we hiked in rain to the base of Upper Yosemite Falls. By the second day, we were tired and looking for something quick and relaxing to do before driving back.
We decided to check out the Sugar Pine Railroad, which was right next to their hotel.</description>

      <description>These damn existential nights are the worst.
I&amp;rsquo;m tired of wasting my nights distracting myself, so I stayed at work late and went to the gym even later, then left around 10:45pm.
Even while exercising I could feel me asking myself nagging questions. Why am I working out? What&amp;rsquo;s the goal? What&amp;rsquo;s the point of keeping your body healthy if you don&amp;rsquo;t even know where you&amp;rsquo;re going?
These are important questions, but not the right questions when I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood.</description>

      <description>Inside Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)  (I originally wrote this while sitting in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan)
I&amp;rsquo;m visiting Japan again, when part of me is constantly thinking I should instead be spending the time and money exploring other parts of the world.
I guess I just find myself coming back to the familiar and (somewhat) comfortable. I find that I have the same habit when returning to a restaurant, and ordering the same item from the menu each and every time.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s well into the new year, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly start the new year off like everyone else, who I imagine all rushed daily into the gym in the first week or two, then apparently gave the habit up soon after.
Sometime in February I found out about a study being conducted at my workplace in conjunction with a university, to track the effects of exercise over the course of a month.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s nearing the year&amp;rsquo;s end, so of course this means a somewhat sentimental blog post from me. I was thinking of a &amp;ldquo;resolutions/goals&amp;rdquo; type post, but I decided against it. Instead here&amp;rsquo;s something more entertaining: my favorite photos from the past year! Note that these aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily my best, just my favorites.
Finding these is also a little bit of housekeeping for me and my photos. It forces me to sort the gigabytes and gigabytes of RAW photos I was casually dumping onto drives the entire year.</description>

      <description>A while back I had a need for a general timeout option for async.parallel and was surprised I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find much information about how to do it. I was using async.parallel to make a lot of REST calls in parallel, but one of them was getting blocked by a firewall, resulting in an eventual timeout minutes later.
One option was to specify a shorter timeout for each individual REST call, including the one causing the problem.</description>

Being experts Hawaii tourists, they set us up in a nice traditional resort called The Mauian - a nice quiet(er) little place that has a time for &amp;ldquo;quiet hours&amp;rdquo; (apparently the other resorts are places to party).
We got back to the hotel a little after quiet hours, and my folks mentioned that you could see the Milky Way quite clearly.</description>

      <description>Intro Over the years there&amp;rsquo;s been a steadily increasing ecosystem of JavaScript components to choose from. The sheer amount of choices is fantastic, but this also infamously presents a difficulty when components are mixed-and-matched. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too long for budding developers to find out that not all components are built to play nicely together.
To address these issues, the competing module specs AMD and CommonJS have appeared on the scene, allowing developers to write their code in an agreed-upon sandboxed and modularized way, so as not to &amp;ldquo;pollute the ecosystem&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The real shame about NSA/PRISM is that everyone will forget about it next week or next month. Just like we forgot about Trapwire and other endless abuses in the name of protecting society.
The US is now a nation too mentally castrated to do anything about these obvious constitutional abuses. Why are we only capable of short-lived and impotent protest attempts like Occupy? How did we get to be so sedated through this anesthesia of modern consumerism and entertainment?</description>

      <description>The other day I glanced at a classmate using Baidu to perform an image search and was impressed with their presentation:

Note the nice big images and the lack of margins around images. After seeing this presentation, I realized that the common approach of adding margins around images is pretty unnecessary.
I also noticed that the images are a variety of sizes, leading to a less sterile experience. There&amp;rsquo;s surely some clever math going on behind the scenes here to make sure the images appear &amp;ldquo;justified&amp;rdquo; (to use a word from the recent Flickr redesign).</description>

Japan has a healthy fascination with the beauty of nature, and this includes the ephemeral cherry blossoms. And one of the prime locations for cherry blossoms is Kyoto, Japan.
It takes a while to realize, but there actually seems to be a wide variety of cherry blossoms which blossom at different times. This stretches the season out a bit (the prime blossoming lasts only about a week).</description>

For the last six months, I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly been using imiwa? for iOS to look up Japanese words whenever I don&amp;rsquo;t know them (mostly in class). However, I found that I built up big lists without ever reviewing them.
The best way to review is of course through Anki, but it was a laborious process to import each word one-by-one.</description>

      <description>Japanese riding a miniature railroad, brought by Perry to Japan  (view the full image, image credit)
A long time ago, four black ships appeared off the coast of Japan, which had closed itself off from the world and its influences. These ships were from the US, and commanding them was Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who was instrumental in reopening Japan to the rest of the world.
As a result of this, and to promote a goodwill between the two countries, Perry gave various gifts to Japan, one of which was a one-fourth scale model train, in order to convincingly demonstrate the benefit of adopting Western technology:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking lately that the fates of so many are motivated by, in a word, escapism. Including my own fate. These are folks whose lives seem quite different on first glance, but turn out to be similar. We can&amp;rsquo;t escape some of our basic human nature after all.
The Preservationist These are folks who, for lack of a better term, wish to preserve a &amp;ldquo;simpler time&amp;rdquo;. They are people such as Thoreau, who wanted a return to simpler times and aspired to self-sufficiency (or an approximation, in any case).</description>

      <description>This is finally the end of my first week in Japanese language school here in Kyoto. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a long week, with the most studying I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done in my life. We&amp;rsquo;ve gone through nine chapters in a week, and just Friday received two more books for learning Kanji. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn our first 50 Kanji in a week, alongside the rest of our classes. I already know some words here and there, but for the most part, much of what we&amp;rsquo;ve just learned is a blur, which is forcing me to use almost all of my free time in running to catch up.</description>

      <title>Descartes on building software frameworks</title>

      <description>Rene Descartes  Years ago I read Descartes&amp;rsquo;s Discourse on Method for what I found to be some of the more interesting philosophy courses of my college career: those of the history of modern philosophy. Modern philosophy technically starts with Descartes, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start, or to get re-acquainted with philosophy in general.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through the Discourse again, and have found it to be more interesting and relatable this time around (particularly about lessons learned while traveling, but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another post).</description>

      <description>Several times I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;the religion of your parents&amp;rsquo; choosing&amp;rdquo;, used to scoff at adherents to various religions, as if they had no intelligent choice in the matter of their own beliefs. As the thought goes, religious standing (or lack thereof) should be a personal matter, one to be decided rationally (yes, there is such a thing as rational faith; to say otherwise is to label all religious people as fideists, which is a mistake) by individuals, apart from their social group if possible.</description>

(check out the Demo)
A while back I had a bit of a field day messing around with input type=&amp;ldquo;range&amp;rdquo;, trying to replicate the &amp;ldquo;unlock slider&amp;rdquo; on iOS using CSS, targeting special WebKit-only CSS pseudoelements such as webkit-slider-thumb.
Well, now I&amp;rsquo;m at it again, this time with a much simpler use case, trying to implement a custom &amp;ldquo;clear&amp;rdquo; button on search field inputs (note that this only works on input type=&amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo;):</description>

      <description>After work today, I stopped by the old bustling Apple Store in Palo Alto. I was there for a bit of a peek at what my next blank check to Apple would bring me.
I was between tables going back and forth between the updated MacBook Pro (non-retina) and the Retina MacBook Pro and came away with some initial impressions. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find these sort of &amp;ldquo;impartial&amp;rdquo; impressions elsewhere, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d record these impressions for myself.</description>

      <description>(2016 note: this was a terrible idea because I&amp;rsquo;m neither a native speaker nor a good speaker in general.. but I&amp;rsquo;m leaving this up for posterity&amp;hellip;)
I have been learning bits and pieces of Japanese throughout the years, and picking up more and more on each of my trips to Japan. But now it&amp;rsquo;s time to buckle down and get disciplined about learning, and make some real progress.
As with learning any language, having a decent vocabulary is critical in order to form coherent sentences, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus on this for the time being, in addition to learning hiragana and katakana and getting it down pat, with no errors.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a flurry of response to this article, entitled &amp;ldquo;What‚Äôs next for mobile now that adaptive design has failed?&amp;rdquo;.
There&amp;rsquo;s many problems with this article, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know where to start.
I will admit that defenders of responsive design have come out of the woodwork in trashing this article, but I suppose I count myself among them, being a proponent of responsive design. I still see the web heading that direction, and I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t see it heading in the direction the author of the article has described.</description>

      <title>New direction (Developer Blog to Blog)</title>

      <guid>https://davidbcalhoun.com/2012/new-direction-developer-blog-to-blog/</guid>
      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve come to terms with the fact I need to try something new in my life - a true change in direction. I anticipate that this blog will take the same direction, so there will likely be less and less &amp;ldquo;developer&amp;rdquo; posts and more and more posts of me living this new path. (TLDR: unsubscribe now, probably!)
Why the change in direction? I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fun, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived a comfortable life where I really haven&amp;rsquo;t had to worry about money (yet), but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the hard way that buying &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t buy happiness.</description>

      <description>This was posted on reddit recently, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d copy my response here.
First, just a quick introduction! There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of thought recently that philosophy is useless. The main arguments seem to be that
 science has replaced any need for philosophy philosophy is a useless subject to study in college  For the latter argument, I recently recorded my thoughts, and you can hear them here. For the first argument, read on&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>UPDATE 2/25/2013 As of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s update last year, it appears that many of the old Facebook URL schemes are no longer working&amp;hellip;. So this post looks to be outdated and useless already&amp;hellip; :)
The skinny Copy this code:
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;fb://publish/profile/me?text=foo&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Post to Facebook&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  {:lang=&amp;ldquo;html&amp;rdquo;}
Explanation As you may know, Facebook has a URL scheme
fb://  which seems to be mainly used by native developers. What most folks don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that it&amp;rsquo;s just a URL scheme, like http://, and that we can use it within our mobile browsers!</description>

As far as web development goes, I guess I could rant on and on about the generalities. Of all things ephemeral. The lust after money, gadgets, and other worthless material crap that we use to stuff inside our oversized houses.
The startling creativity and in equal amounts the lack of creativity. The amount of amazing invention and the equal amount of copying and ripping off.</description>

      <description>Introduction Ever since Steve Souders started evangelizing web performance, it&amp;rsquo;s been pounded into our heads that extra HTTP requests add a lot of additional overhead, and that we should combine them if possible to dramatically decrease the load time of our web pages.
The practical implication of this has been to combine our JavaScript and CSS files, which is relatively easy and straightforward, but the harder question has been what to do with images.</description>

To the newcomer this is definitely a bad thing, as it means not only more things to learn, but more little caveats and more places to go wrong. And so it is with declaring functions!</description>

      <description>(OR &amp;ldquo;The Post In Which I Conflate Programming and Philosophy&amp;rdquo; OR &amp;ldquo;The Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Existentialist Crisis&amp;rdquo;)
I woke up this morning to read Dmitry A. Soshnikov&amp;rsquo;s tweet:

While this seems like good advice for aspiring programmers, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think what this means for those who will buy into this. Us programmers have a keen ability to sit and focus on problems for extended periods of time, usually to the detriment of everything else around us.</description>

      <title>Checking for undefined, null, and empty variables in JavaScript</title>

      <description>In general it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to check for the existence of something before blindly using it by faith and hoping it works. There are various times during the execution of scripts when a variable may not be defined, it may be null, or it might be an empty string. These are three things that are easily conflated. A good way to look at this is thinking of these as having increasing levels of existence (getting a bit philosophical here for a moment&amp;hellip;):</description>

      <description>This is just a fun little video demo into the inner workings of today&amp;rsquo;s Google Doodle. Nothing you can&amp;rsquo;t do yourself with Firebug or Web Inspector (built into WebKit browsers such as Safari and Chrome). But I liked this doodle so much, I wanted to talk about it!

Introduction After reading &amp;ldquo;What the Heck is Shadow DOM?&amp;rdquo; I was inspired to see how far I could style the &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;range&amp;quot;&amp;gt; element. Pretty far, as it turns out!
My goal was to change the input&amp;rsquo;s default appearance:
To the visual appearance of the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s unlock slider:
As far as I can tell, only WebKit-based browsers and Opera have implemented input type=range. Mobile Safari hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented it as of iOS 4.</description>

Twitter This merits a category of its own. This has replaced the RSS reader for a lot of folks, or at the very least supplemented it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently recommended Nathan Smith&amp;rsquo;s list of JavaScript folks. When I&amp;rsquo;m diligent, I keep up with this several times a week and favorite items from the feed to be considered for inclusion in that week&amp;rsquo;s JSMag Blog update.</description>

      <guid>https://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/what-happens-when-you-have-no-javascript-fallback/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what happens when your interface completely relies on JavaScript. There&amp;rsquo;s code with translated mojibake of some sort which caused the JavaScript to break. The code wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a try-catch block, so it caused all of the code on the page to fail, thus presenting me with the only part of the screen that wasn&amp;rsquo;t generated by JavaScript: the completely useless header.
Where&amp;rsquo;s the tweets!?</description>

      <title>How to spot outdated JavaScript</title>

      <guid>https://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/how-to-spot-outdated-javascript/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Those that are just setting out to learn JavaScript are typically overwhelmed by the amount of online resources to be found about learning JavaScript. Not only this, but every webpage visited presents a potential learning opportunity just by inspecting the source.
However, not all resources are guaranteed to be up-to-date. JavaScript has been around for over a decade, and coding standards have changed drastically over time. While a code snippet may still work in today&amp;rsquo;s browsers, you may unknowingly be using an outdated practice that might eventually lead to a bit of embarrassment.</description>

      <description>Intro There have been many attempts to answer this question in a succinct way, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been satisfied by them. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt at a (relatively) concise explanation.
This is adapted from a reply I posted on reddit which people seemed to have found useful.
Broad definition Normally when people talk about closures in JavaScript, they&amp;rsquo;re talking about methods and properties that outlive the scope of their original function (more on that in a second), but actually the definition is a bit broader.</description>

      <description>Introduction When people started to learn about the HTML5 doctype, they kind of freaked out a little, not knowing how older browsers would handle it. A post by Dustin Diaz prompted me to test out how pages rendered (in QuirksMode or Standards Mode) with a little help from document.compatMode, and I found that surprisingly every browser rendered in Standards Mode with the new doctype. In other words, no need to worry!</description>

      <guid>https://davidbcalhoun.com/2010/top-ten-things-html5-makes-simpler/</guid>
      <description>General word of caution: not all of these HTML5 simplifications are compatible with older browsers. Test it for yourself before implementing!
1. The doctype Old &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &amp;quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&amp;quot; &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  New &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;  2. charset Old &amp;lt;meta http-equiv=&amp;quot;Content-Type&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  New &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  3. The link tag‚Äôs type attribute Old &amp;lt;link href=&amp;quot;style.css&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  New &amp;lt;link href=&amp;quot;style.css&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  This one may be a bit controversial, but the HTML5 spec actually tells browser vendors not to treat the type attribute as the final word, which makes it seem pretty redundant:</description>

      <description>Alex Kessinger tweeted asking if there was a reason to still use EMs instead of PX measurements in mobile. This is an interesting question, but 140 characters isn&amp;rsquo;t quite enough to explain my thoughts. So here&amp;rsquo;s an old-fashioned blog post!
Just a quick review: em and percentage (%) units in CSS are relative measurements, whereas px and other measurements are not. What this means is that the resulting size of relative measurements depends on the size of the parent.</description>

      <description>The problem On the desktop we&amp;rsquo;re quite privileged to have nice debugging tools such as Firebug and Web Inspector in Webkit-based browsers. But when it comes to mobile, debugging JavaScript with console.log.
isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as easy.
Probably the best available tool on mobile at the moment is mobile Safari&amp;rsquo;s console, which looks like the following when enabled (Settings -&amp;gt; Safari -&amp;gt; Developer -&amp;gt; Debug Console):

      <description>Introduction Often times I end up creating short pages for testing short pieces of code, and I only need a very basic HTML template to write in. Short of using HTML5 Boilerplate, I just use a quick piece of code like the following. (note: yes, this has issues in IE, so you may want to use HTML5 Shiv/Shim)
The code &amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;viewport&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you read part 4 of this series, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that because of the variety of screen sizes, the best way to develop for mobile is to develop fluid layouts that take 100% of the available space on the screen.
What you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t think of is that there&amp;rsquo;s different screen widths even on the same device! This is due to screen orientation. And when the user changes the screen orientation, stuff may break (hey, it&amp;rsquo;s not a perfect world).</description>

      <description>I stumbled across this concept recently and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share it, because I don&amp;rsquo;t generally see this pattern being used. More importantly, I also share test results that show that maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not always a good idea to use this pattern&amp;hellip;
The problem with Switch statements The basic switch statement in JavaScript looks something like this:
var foo = &#39;c&#39;; switch(foo) { case &#39;a&#39;: break; case &#39;b&#39;: break; case &#39;c&#39;: break; default: }  So what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this?</description>

      <title>Targeting Internet Explorer (IE): the age-old struggle</title>

      <description>As long as I can remember, developers have always been trying to target IE one way or another. Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, there have been multiple ways to pull this off.
I guess I really haven&amp;#8217;t been keeping up with the latest frontend trends (doh!), as I&amp;#8217;ve just recently discovered this very elegant solution circa 2008 offered by Paul Irish, which sticks a class on the body tag using proprietary conditional IE tags (no JavaScript magic needed here!</description>

      <title>How to install obsolete Android Virtual Devices (AVDs)</title>

      <description>Apparently it&amp;#8217;s no longer possible to easily download Android versions 2.0 and 2.0.1 from the AVD Manager. I noticed this problem when I got a new machine and had to install everything from scratch. In the future I suspect even more AVDs will be made obsolete, so this solution also applies to them.
Why would you want to install obsolete AVDs? In my case it&amp;#8217;s a matter of research: I simply want to see the progress of features being added to its browser, and track those changes over time.</description>

      <description>In episode 6 of The Big Web Show, Luke Wroblewski gives his &amp;#8220;Mobile First&amp;#8221; talk, explaining his philosophy for designing for mobile, the challenges, and a look at the road ahead. Luke explains that because of the limitations on mobile, developers are forced to really optimize the user experience for mobile. Often times this mobile experience turns out much better than on the desktop, where the &amp;#8220;gluttony of resources&amp;#8221; results in distracting and excessive webpages.</description>

      <description>The frontend engineer lives at the intersection between design and engineering, and this is perhaps nowhere more true than in the world of mobile. In order to make a usable desktop website, an engineer must have at least some sense of design, and fortunately a lot of this has been standardized over the years. But the world of mobile is full of more unknowns, and the field is changing rapidly, especially lately from the shift away from older feature phones to the focus on smartphones.</description>

      <description>A button is something that seems to be made just for mobile: it&amp;#8217;s designed to be big and easy to activate, as opposed to small and harder to activate, like normal text links. This seems ideal for a mobile devices, which have a small display area and whose form of input is a person&amp;#8217;s (relatively) fat finger interacting with the screen. Contrast this with the desktop, where the display area is much larger and the input device, the mouse, is a much more highly refined and sensitive pointing device.</description>

      <description>Tools of the trade You&amp;#8217;re no mobile developer unless you have the tools to develop on mobile! And while it&amp;#8217;s good to own at least one of the smartphones you&amp;#8217;re developing on, it&amp;#8217;s probably unrealistic to think that you&amp;#8217;re going to go out of your way to buy several other unlocked smartphones just to test with. So you should have the next best thing: an SDK!
But an SDK is just one of the tools of the trade.</description>

It assumes at least a basic knowledge of creating desktop websites.
The problem Ok, so you&amp;rsquo;ve settled down to learn how to write a website for a mobile device using your current knowledge of building desktop websites. So you start off with some pretty basic HTML:</description>

      <description>According to the statistics available on statcounter.com, from January 2009 to January 2010, iPhone browser traffic share actually decreased, not increased, as one might expect.
This is likely due to new competition from Android phones, as well as the possibility that more users are simply using iPhone native apps instead of web apps.
In any case, in my opinion these are the figures we ought to be looking at, not overall phone sales, as others such as PPK concentrate on.</description>

      <description>Color keywords Example usage:
// Example body { color: red; } // Generalization (not actual code) body { color: color_name; } Because color names are easy to remember, they&amp;#8217;re handy for getting quick results, especially while doing rapid prototyping.
W3C&amp;#8217;s CSS1 recommendation first mentioned 16 color keywords that you can use: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow:
   Color   Hexadecimal   Color   Hexadecimal   Color   Hexadecimal   Color   Hexadecimal     aqua / cyan  #00FFFF   gray  #808080   navy  #000080   silver  #C0C0C0     black  #000000   green  #008000   olive  #808000   teal  #008080     blue  #0000FF   lime  #00FF00   purple  #800080   white  #FFFFFF     fuchsia / magenta  #FF00FF   maroon  #800000   red  #FF0000   yellow  #FFFF00    (color table from Wikipedia)</description>

 Usually developers are more interested in just getting the dang code to work, and as a result actual the testing and maintenance of JavaScript isn&amp;#8217;t talked about too much, so I&amp;#8217;m sure this will be new territory for many developers. And since it&amp;#8217;s John Resig speaking, there was of course a bit about using TestSwarm, a testing distributed framework-agnostic automated testing tool (that&amp;#8217;s a mouthful!</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re probably used to typical variables names such as the following:
var personName = &#39;Joe&#39;;  You may not realize it, but there are some non-alphanumeric variables at your disposal.
Using $ For instance, the $ variable has been made popular by several JavaScript libraries, most notably jQuery. You can use it to alias operations that are commonly performed, such as the following (1):
var $ = document.getElementById; var myElement = $(&#39;targetElement&#39;);  If you declare this variable outside of a function it will be a global variable and will compete with libraries that use the same global variable, so it&amp;rsquo;s probably best not to use it.</description>

      <description>Passing data is quite important in functional programming languages like JavaScript. When there are multiple functions (which is most of the time), there needs to be a way to pass data between the functions. This is done by passing values in parenthesis: myFunction(myData). Even when there is no data to be passed, we still have to declare and execute functions by using parenthesis: myFunction().
Simple Passing I&amp;rsquo;ve already referred to the common method of passing data.</description>

      <title>IEMobile 6/7 bug: classes and id not supported on the HTML element</title>

      <description>As it turns out, IEMobile 6&amp;frasl;7 (and presumably anything earlier) doesn&amp;#8217;t support classes and ids that are attached to the HTML element. I confirmed this on both IEMobile 6 and 7. Fortunately it looks to be fixed in IEMobile 8 (which makes sense, since it works fine in desktop IE6, which it&amp;#8217;s based on).
The consequence of this is that adding an id/class to the html tag will result in the style not being applied to the document:</description>

      <title>PHP: dealing with stuff that doesn&#39;t exist</title>

      <description>Introduction As the application you&amp;#8217;re coding becomes more and more complex, there&amp;#8217;s more of an opportunity for things to go wrong in all sorts of unforseen ways. One of these problems is variables or functions that don&amp;#8217;t exist. The problem is when you code in such a way that you presuppose their existence. But their existence isn&amp;#8217;t guaranteed!
A simple case of this happening is when you&amp;#8217;re dealing with user input.</description>

      <title>Pitfalls of declaring variables in JavaScript</title>

      <description>Introduction One of the things that&amp;#8217;s always been confusing to me is that there are multiple ways to declare variables in JavaScript, and some ways are better than others. For the beginner programmer, just getting to code to work means complete success, but for the intermediate or advanced programmer, this is just the first step. The next step is to clean up the code and make sure everything is written in the best way it could have been written.</description>

      <title>JavaScript Tidbit: Block scope with let</title>
      <link>https://davidbcalhoun.com/2009/javascript-tidbit-block-scope-with-let/</link>

      <description>JavaScript has functional scope. Meaning that if you (properly) define variables within functions, those variables remain accessible only inside the function.
Block scope, on the other hand, defines scope within a block of code, usually defined by braces. JavaScript now has block scope as of version 1.7, which means it&amp;#8217;s available in these browsers:
 Firefox 2+  Block scope is enabled in JavaScript with the use of &amp;#8220;let&amp;#8221;:
let(x=100) { alert(x); }; It also works perfectly well on one line, without the use of braces:</description>

      <title>JavaScript Tidbit: Shorthand Object Instantiation</title>
      <link>https://davidbcalhoun.com/2009/javascript-tidbit-shorthand-object-instantiation/</link>

      <guid>https://davidbcalhoun.com/2009/javascript-tidbit-shorthand-object-instantiation/</guid>
      <description>The skinny: here&amp;#8217;s a neat little trick to reduce the amount of code users have to type to instantiate objects:
function jQuery(str, con){ if ( window == this ) return new jQuery(str, con); // ... } new jQuery(&amp;quot;#foo&amp;quot;); // this is now equivalent... jQuery(&amp;quot;#foo&amp;quot;); // ...to this!  {:lang=&amp;ldquo;js&amp;rdquo;}
Explanation: when jQuery(&amp;#8220;#foo&amp;#8221;) is typed, the function first determines if the context in which it&amp;#8217;s being called is the global object (window).</description>

      <description>class Singleton { private static $instance; public static function getInstance() { if(!isset(self::$instance)) { $c = __CLASS__; self::$instance = new $c(); } return self::$instance; } } And the explanation&amp;#8230;
class Singleton { private static $instance; // static variable to hold our 1 instance public static function getInstance() { // function to get the 1 instance if(!isset(self::$instance)) { // this will only run once (and instantiate once) $c = __CLASS__; // get the class (Singleton) self::$instance = new $c(); // instantiate the class and store it in our variable } return self::$instance; // return the instance } public static function myFunction() { // we can get to this through Singleton::getInstance()-myFunction() // .</description>

      <title>IE Mobile 6.12 problem: browser ignores the specificity of CSS display styles</title>

      <description>UPDATE: I found that the problem is actually that inline-block is completely unsupported in this version of IE Mobile, and is likely also unsupported in IE Mobile 7, which is also based on IE4. This is in contrast to desktop IE6, where inline-block is supported on elements that are natively inline (span, em, etc.).
Just found this today, for what it&amp;#8217;s worth.¬†If you&amp;#8217;re unlucky enough to be working with older Windows Mobile phones you have probably realized that the browser is based on IE6, which all the desktop web developers notoriously complain about constantly.</description>
