Thank you! Thanks to everyone who helped me on my AT journey! Special thanks:
 to my mom for helping mail me resupply packages to my sister and her family for their support, small snacks, kids&amp;rsquo; drawings for support, and for liking some of my best picture uploads to my friends James and Jessica for the very generous care package which helped me get back on the trail after a month away to Gomer Pyle (John) and Sawbones (Sarah) who let me tag along with them and bought me too many meals, drinks, and even a book.</description>
