      <title>Stifling Laughter in Distant Places</title>

      <description>New Cultures The first days of traveling usually involves laughing at the quaint and unusual customs of another culture. That sounds close-minded, because in many cases it probably is. But it&amp;rsquo;s something we all do, of course including yours truly. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a coping mechanism - laughing at things in the face of difficulties and differences.
To be fair, we&amp;rsquo;re thinking creatures, and as such it&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard for us not to draw comparisons with our own home city and culture.</description>

      <description>Hello friends! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while without an update.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working more and more on my photography endeavors, which includes building up a YouTube channel to document my travels and also my learnings. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it&amp;rsquo;s interesting and useful enough, especially for other aspiring photographers.
This year is definitely shaping up to be a year of travelling, and I&amp;rsquo;d also like to keep a blog of photos and such, so I&amp;rsquo;m working to get a separate photography blog setup at my photography website.</description>

      <title>Beginning thoughts on the idea of a Great American Road Trip</title>

      <description>The idea of a trip across the United States has become somewhat of an American institution. Something like a New American Dream, this one maybe a bit more accessible than that house, happy life, and nuclear family with 2.5 kids. It&amp;rsquo;s something that is undertaken by both the young and the old, with the former perhaps hitchhiking or sleeping in their cars while the latter leapfrog between National Parks in their expensive and comfortable motor homes.</description>

      <title>My year in photos (2016)</title>

      <description>A few years back I put together my favorite photos of the year (see it: part one and part two). I decided to resurrect the tradition, and I hope to keep it going in the coming years!
Onto the pics!
February I visited Yosemite twice, first by myself and later with my friend Kevin.
Night sky from Yosemite  For this shot I drove to the empty Bridalveil Falls parking lot and placed an LED lantern in the middle of the parking lot, then shot straight up.</description>

      <description>A few years back I had the opportunity to visit New Orleans in the spring with my friend. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve returned with my parents to visit in the fall!
My mom had recently expressed a desire to do more travelling while still physically able, which kicked off creating a list of places to visit, and ultimately booking this first trip. Hopefully the first of many to come. She asked if I wanted to tag along, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass up another visit to the city.</description>

      <title>Photo assignment: Kyoto alleyways at night</title>

      <guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/photo-assignment-kyoto-alleyways-at-night/</guid>
      <description>Before setting off on my current trip, I wanted to give myself at least one &amp;ldquo;photo assignment&amp;rdquo;: some goal I could aim to accomplish by pretending like I&amp;rsquo;d been given an assignment by some employer.
This is the first of what I hope will be many. The assignment here is to try to capture the atmosphere of eastern Kyoto&amp;rsquo;s traditional streets at night.
A couple of things I had to plan for: Kyoto is a bit far from my hostel in Osaka, so I made sure to make a day trip out of it.</description>

      <title>The roads of Indonesia</title>

      <description>The biggest culture shock of Indonesia had to be the bathroom facilities, but that&amp;rsquo;s best saved for another post. The second biggest culture shock had to be the roads, and the drivers on them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to any third world Asian country before, so the idea of seeing roads dominated by scooters and motorcycles was really a foreign concept to me. This also meant that the style of driving is way different.</description>

      <description>Rinku town and Kansai Airport at night  (I wrote this one a few weeks back but didn&amp;rsquo;t post the pics until now, so here it is in its complete form!).
I&amp;rsquo;ve been here in Japan for a month and in true form haven&amp;rsquo;t provided much in the way of updates since then. Doh.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a catch-up post, with plenty of pictures and videos to keep things interesting.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Japan for the past few weeks, and have been lazy about updating my blog, which I promised to do! I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy sorting through pictures!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a video update from where I&amp;rsquo;ll be staying long term at a place called the Banana House:

      <description>Front view of the Sugar Pine Railroad  On my last trip to Yosemite, I tagged along with my friends Kevin and Mari. The first day we hiked in rain to the base of Upper Yosemite Falls. By the second day, we were tired and looking for something quick and relaxing to do before driving back.
We decided to check out the Sugar Pine Railroad, which was right next to their hotel.</description>

      <description>Inside Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan (Photo copyright David Calhoun)  (I originally wrote this while sitting in Cafe Rhinebeck in Kyoto, Japan)
I&amp;rsquo;m visiting Japan again, when part of me is constantly thinking I should instead be spending the time and money exploring other parts of the world.
I guess I just find myself coming back to the familiar and (somewhat) comfortable. I find that I have the same habit when returning to a restaurant, and ordering the same item from the menu each and every time.</description>

      <description>I was just putting together this article and these photos on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve when I glanced and the clock and noticed I was already four minutes into 2015. Oops!
Here&amp;rsquo;s the second-parter for my favorite photo from 2014. Also be sure to check out the first part.
July Yuka was still here in early July, just in time to see Fourth of July fireworks at Big Bear Lake, California, before she had to go back to Japan.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s nearing the year&amp;rsquo;s end, so of course this means a somewhat sentimental blog post from me. I was thinking of a &amp;ldquo;resolutions/goals&amp;rdquo; type post, but I decided against it. Instead here&amp;rsquo;s something more entertaining: my favorite photos from the past year! Note that these aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily my best, just my favorites.
Finding these is also a little bit of housekeeping for me and my photos. It forces me to sort the gigabytes and gigabytes of RAW photos I was casually dumping onto drives the entire year.</description>

      <description>Milky Way galaxyrise from Maui (at the Mauian hotel)  I was lucky enough to finally visit Hawaii with my parents. Being experts Hawaii tourists, they set us up in a nice traditional resort called The Mauian - a nice quiet(er) little place that has a time for &amp;ldquo;quiet hours&amp;rdquo; (apparently the other resorts are places to party).
We got back to the hotel a little after quiet hours, and my folks mentioned that you could see the Milky Way quite clearly.</description>

      <description>Cherry blossoms in Kyoto, Japan 2013  Check out my cherry blossoms 2013 set on Flickr.
Japan has a healthy fascination with the beauty of nature, and this includes the ephemeral cherry blossoms. And one of the prime locations for cherry blossoms is Kyoto, Japan.
It takes a while to realize, but there actually seems to be a wide variety of cherry blossoms which blossom at different times. This stretches the season out a bit (the prime blossoming lasts only about a week).</description>
