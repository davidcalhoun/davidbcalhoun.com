      <description>(note: this is based on the first iOS5 beta [9A5220p] and is subject to change on final release)
It looks like there&#39;s finally some major improvements in mobile Safari, some of which I&#39;ve found below on my &amp;ldquo;first glance&amp;rdquo; after downloading the SDK. Chime in if you find anything yourself!
Bad news first Much to my disappointment, browser-based file uploads are still not supported (input type=&amp;quot;file&amp;rdquo;), even though they have been supported on Android since version 2.</description>

      <title>Is a hash faster than a Switch in JavaScript?</title>

      <description>I stumbled across this concept recently and I thought I&#39;d share it, because I don&#39;t generally see this pattern being used. More importantly, I also share test results that show that maybe it&#39;s not always a good idea to use this pattern&amp;hellip;
The problem with Switch statements The basic switch statement in JavaScript looks something like this:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  var foo = &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;; switch(foo) { case &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;: break; case &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;: break; case &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;: break; default: }   So what&#39;s wrong with this?</description>
