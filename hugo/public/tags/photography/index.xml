      <description>When the year&amp;rsquo;s days shorten and their number dwindles, I have liked to sometimes take the initiative to sort through all the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken (with my &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; camera). The eventual goal: to put together a sampling of the photos that stand out, sometimes for technical reasons, and sometimes for other reasons.
This year I sadly didn&amp;rsquo;t get out with the camera as much as I have in previous years, which made this post much easier (no excuses this year!</description>

      <description>Hello friends! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while without an update.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working more and more on my photography endeavors, which includes building up a YouTube channel to document my travels and also my learnings. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it&amp;rsquo;s interesting and useful enough, especially for other aspiring photographers.
This year is definitely shaping up to be a year of travelling, and I&amp;rsquo;d also like to keep a blog of photos and such, so I&amp;rsquo;m working to get a separate photography blog setup at my photography website.</description>

      <description>A few years back I put together my favorite photos of the year (see it: part one and part two). I decided to resurrect the tradition, and I hope to keep it going in the coming years!
Onto the pics!
February I visited Yosemite twice, first by myself and later with my friend Kevin.
Night sky from Yosemite  For this shot I drove to the empty Bridalveil Falls parking lot and placed an LED lantern in the middle of the parking lot, then shot straight up.</description>

      <description>A few years back I had the opportunity to visit New Orleans in the spring with my friend. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve returned with my parents to visit in the fall!
My mom had recently expressed a desire to do more travelling while still physically able, which kicked off creating a list of places to visit, and ultimately booking this first trip. Hopefully the first of many to come. She asked if I wanted to tag along, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass up another visit to the city.</description>

      <title>Photo assignment: Kyoto alleyways at night</title>

      <description>Before setting off on my current trip, I wanted to give myself at least one &amp;ldquo;photo assignment&amp;rdquo;: some goal I could aim to accomplish by pretending like I&amp;rsquo;d been given an assignment by some employer.
This is the first of what I hope will be many. The assignment here is to try to capture the atmosphere of eastern Kyoto&amp;rsquo;s traditional streets at night.
A couple of things I had to plan for: Kyoto is a bit far from my hostel in Osaka, so I made sure to make a day trip out of it.</description>

      <description>Rinku town and Kansai Airport at night  (I wrote this one a few weeks back but didn&amp;rsquo;t post the pics until now, so here it is in its complete form!).
I&amp;rsquo;ve been here in Japan for a month and in true form haven&amp;rsquo;t provided much in the way of updates since then. Doh.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a catch-up post, with plenty of pictures and videos to keep things interesting.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Japan for the past few weeks, and have been lazy about updating my blog, which I promised to do! I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy sorting through pictures!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a video update from where I&amp;rsquo;ll be staying long term at a place called the Banana House:

      <title>11 mile Big Basin hike</title>

      <description>GPS track log  See the interactive GPS track log here.
I really needed to get out of Silicon Valley again and go experience nature, so on Sunday I drove over to my favorite hiking spot, Big Basin. There&amp;rsquo;s a $10 fee to get in and park, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it considering it&amp;rsquo;s about the price of a movie and much more rewarding.
I arrived right after the park opened and started my hike to Berry Creek Falls at 8:20am, which is probably the earliest I&amp;rsquo;ve started there.</description>

      <title>Big Basin October Hike</title>

      <description>GPS track log  See the interactive GPS track log here.
On Sunday I grabbed two sandwiches at Le Boulanger, and headed for a late hike in Big Basin, which is my favorite place to hike in the area. The drive from my apartment in Sunnyvale is almost an hour and a half, and the fee to park is $10, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it to go and spend time there once and a while.</description>

      <description>I was just putting together this article and these photos on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve when I glanced and the clock and noticed I was already four minutes into 2015. Oops!
Here&amp;rsquo;s the second-parter for my favorite photo from 2014. Also be sure to check out the first part.
July Yuka was still here in early July, just in time to see Fourth of July fireworks at Big Bear Lake, California, before she had to go back to Japan.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s nearing the year&amp;rsquo;s end, so of course this means a somewhat sentimental blog post from me. I was thinking of a &amp;ldquo;resolutions/goals&amp;rdquo; type post, but I decided against it. Instead here&amp;rsquo;s something more entertaining: my favorite photos from the past year! Note that these aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily my best, just my favorites.
Finding these is also a little bit of housekeeping for me and my photos. It forces me to sort the gigabytes and gigabytes of RAW photos I was casually dumping onto drives the entire year.</description>

      <description>Milky Way galaxyrise from Maui (at the Mauian hotel)  I was lucky enough to finally visit Hawaii with my parents. Being experts Hawaii tourists, they set us up in a nice traditional resort called The Mauian - a nice quiet(er) little place that has a time for &amp;ldquo;quiet hours&amp;rdquo; (apparently the other resorts are places to party).
We got back to the hotel a little after quiet hours, and my folks mentioned that you could see the Milky Way quite clearly.</description>

      <description>Cherry blossoms in Kyoto, Japan 2013  Check out my cherry blossoms 2013 set on Flickr.
Japan has a healthy fascination with the beauty of nature, and this includes the ephemeral cherry blossoms. And one of the prime locations for cherry blossoms is Kyoto, Japan.
It takes a while to realize, but there actually seems to be a wide variety of cherry blossoms which blossom at different times. This stretches the season out a bit (the prime blossoming lasts only about a week).</description>
