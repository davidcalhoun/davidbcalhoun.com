      <description>Front view of the Sugar Pine Railroad  On my last trip to Yosemite, I tagged along with my friends Kevin and Mari. The first day we hiked in rain to the base of Upper Yosemite Falls. By the second day, we were tired and looking for something quick and relaxing to do before driving back.
We decided to check out the Sugar Pine Railroad, which was right next to their hotel.</description>
