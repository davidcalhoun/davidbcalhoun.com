      <description>UPDATE: I found that the problem is actually that inline-block is completely unsupported in this version of IE Mobile, and is likely also unsupported in IE Mobile 7, which is also based on IE4. This is in contrast to desktop IE6, where inline-block is supported on elements that are natively inline (span, em, etc.).
Just found this today, for what it’s worth. If you’re unlucky enough to be working with older Windows Mobile phones you have probably realized that the browser is based on IE6, which all the desktop web developers notoriously complain about constantly.</description>
