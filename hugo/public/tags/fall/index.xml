      <description>Maple leaves at Tofukuji Temple, Kyoto  It&amp;rsquo;s autumn again. The temperatures are dropping up here in the mountains of Big Bear, especially at night, when it&amp;rsquo;s now approaching freezing or below. A surprising number of trees are changing colors. I say surprising because this is California, after all, and we don&amp;rsquo;t usually see fall colors unless we know where to look.
The aspens are of course doing their thing and changing from green to yellow, and there are other surprising splashes of red and orange as I drive through the neighborhood.</description>
