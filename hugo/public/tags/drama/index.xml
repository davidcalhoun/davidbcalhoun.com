      <description>The Godfather opening logo  Intro It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, but I&amp;rsquo;m still at it! I&amp;rsquo;m on a journey to watch and review all of the top 100 films, using a list I worked out a while back. I recommend checking out that original post
Today&amp;rsquo;s film is one that is undeniably near the top of many &amp;ldquo;top 100&amp;rdquo; lists: The Godfather.
Opening shot: &#39;I believe in America&#39;  The Story I&amp;rsquo;m actually not a super big fan of the film, but it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining and really well done of course, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to deny it the attention it deserves.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Casablanca more than a few times, and it&amp;rsquo;s become one of my favorite films. For this review I got to experience it in 35mm at the wonderful nearby Stanford Theatre.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not how I first experienced it. I first watched it at home and half paid attention to it. A lot of the movie was lost on me and I thought it was overrated, just ok, and not that great.</description>

      <title>Schindler&#39;s List (1993) (Top 100 Films)</title>

      <description>Schindler&#39;s List title card with candles  This is a film that is best experienced, not explained in a post like this. However, that being said, I&amp;rsquo;ll give this a try anyhow.
I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided this film all my life out of dread more than anything. It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat weird then that I watched this so early in my &amp;ldquo;Top 100&amp;rdquo; films quest. I knew I&amp;rsquo;d have to watch it eventually anyhow.</description>

      <title>Ikiru (1952) (Top 100 Films)</title>

      <description>IKIRU, 生きる, TO LIVE  This is an existentialist story about a man who learns he has stomach cancer, leading to his reconsidering of life, which he realizes has been utterly wasted up until this point.
As it turns out, he realizes he hasn&amp;rsquo;t really been living at all. What&amp;rsquo;s inadvertently happened is that his job has turned into his life - the job of being section chief at one of the endless wasteful government bureaucracies.</description>
