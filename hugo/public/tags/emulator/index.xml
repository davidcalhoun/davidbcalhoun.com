      <description>Apparently it&amp;#8217;s no longer possible to easily download Android versions 2.0 and 2.0.1 from the AVD Manager. I noticed this problem when I got a new machine and had to install everything from scratch. In the future I suspect even more AVDs will be made obsolete, so this solution also applies to them.
Why would you want to install obsolete AVDs? In my case it&amp;#8217;s a matter of research: I simply want to see the progress of features being added to its browser, and track those changes over time.</description>

      <description>Tools of the trade You&amp;#8217;re no mobile developer unless you have the tools to develop on mobile! And while it&amp;#8217;s good to own at least one of the smartphones you&amp;#8217;re developing on, it&amp;#8217;s probably unrealistic to think that you&amp;#8217;re going to go out of your way to buy several other unlocked smartphones just to test with. So you should have the next best thing: an SDK!
But an SDK is just one of the tools of the trade.</description>
