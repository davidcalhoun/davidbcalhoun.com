      <description>⚠️ Warning: this is an old article and may include information that&amp;rsquo;s out of date. ⚠️ A button is something that seems to be made just for mobile: it’s designed to be big and easy to activate, as opposed to small and harder to activate, like normal text links. This seems ideal for a mobile devices, which have a small display area and whose form of input is a person’s (relatively) fat finger interacting with the screen.</description>
