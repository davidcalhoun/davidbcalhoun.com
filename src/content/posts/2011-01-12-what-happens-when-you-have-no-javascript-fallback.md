Here's an example of what happens when your interface completely relies on JavaScript. There's code with translated [mojibake][2] of some sort which caused the JavaScript to break. The code wasn't in a try-catch block, so it caused all of the code on the page to fail, thus presenting me with the only part of the screen that wasn't generated by JavaScript: the completely useless header.

Where's the tweets!?
