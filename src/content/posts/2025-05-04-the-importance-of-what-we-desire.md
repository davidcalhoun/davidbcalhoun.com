Is it possible that a person can reach a point of no return?  Having been brought up one way, not only their beliefs but also their desires permanently fixed?

## Desire baggage

When I lived in Japan, I was thousands of miles away, and several times I had a craving for comfort foods that I grew up with.  I wrote home and asked my parents and grandparents to send me this food that was hard to get (Cheez-Its and Altoids namely).  This is what I desired because I knew them from my upbringing, and I knew eating them would bring me comfort in my time of homesickness.  Some of these, like the Cheez-Its, were things I would never buy in my current day-to-day grocery shopping, but it was something always in the house while growing up.

In a way I brought extra baggage on my trip: my desires that were formed from my upbringing.

Is there any way to reshape this so I would have a craving for different comfort food?

## Belief baggage

I also brought extra baggage in the form of belief.  While living in Japan I felt a pretty deep visceral disconnect at the heavy rules-based conformist society, something really antithetical to my experience growing up in the US, which is individualist to a fault, at the other extreme.

As much as I first loved living in Japan, this different attitude became somewhat overbearing.  Even small daily interactions were reminders of this.  For example, there is exactly one way to do things.  Anything else is incorrect.  One way to introduce yourself to new people, to accept their business card, etc.  There is even one exacty way to open an onigiri from the convenience store (a friend showed me this after seeing my own wrong attempt).

## Struggling to adapt, and what philosophers have to say
If I had been raised in Japan I would have likely had different comfort foods and different beliefs about conformist society, which ultimately would have made it more comfortable for me to live in Japan longer than I did.  With a different upbringing I might actually, at my core, have been a different person.

It turns out education is pivotal, and thinkers across time agree.  Education comes up again and again in both western and eastern philosophy.

The Analects, a collection of saying from Kongzi (Confucious), opens talking about education:

> "Is it not a pleasure to learn and repeatedly practice what you have learned?"
>
> Analects 1.1

He even explained that education isn't just something for kids - it's a lifelong learning process.  And it takes decades to reshape oneself to actually desire the proper things (like getting to the point where we truly desire health food, and not junk food like Cheez-Its):

> The Master said, “At fifteen, I set my mind upon learning;
>
> at thirty, I took my place in society;
>
> at forty, I became free of doubts;
>
> at fifty, I understood Heaven’s Mandate;
>
> at sixty, my ear was attuned;
>
> and at seventy, I could follow my heart’s desires without overstepping the bounds of propriety.”
>

Later, Confucian thinker Mengzhi (Mencius) used the metaphor of Ox Mountain to explain that humans are born good and turn bad only when deprived of nurturing (and using his analogy of sprouts which would later flourish into full virtues, given the right conditions):

> The woods on Ox Mountain were once beautiful! On account of its being on the edge of a large country, it had been attacked with axes and hatchets, and then how could it remain beautiful? The refreshing breezes of day and night, and the moisture provided by rain and fog, did not fail to give rise to sprouts of vegetation. But cows and sheep have been repeatedly pastured there, and for that reason it has remained desolate. People observe its denuded state and assume that it never had any good resources. But how could this state be the true nature of this mountain?"
>
> Mencius, 6A:8

Plato later used the Parable of the Cave to explain that most of the world is essentially slaves to their (wrongheaded) desires.  They want to stay in the cave, it's comfortable.  These folks will continue with the business of the world, namely moneymaking, and never have a desire for something higher.  In fact, they will laugh at those who aspire higher, like the philosopher who must re-enter the cave (and rule it, for the good of everyone).

And Plato's student Aristotle - said it makes all the difference.  Importantly, the type of consitution one is raised in is also crucial in shaping beliefs about how a society should be ruled.  For us, growing up in a democracy gives us a very democratic way of looking at the world.
