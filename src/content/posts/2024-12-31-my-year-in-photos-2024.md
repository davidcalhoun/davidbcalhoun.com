Another year over...

I wasn't very active with my photography this year so this one's quite sparse.  I am of course thankful for the trips I was able to take.

Keeping it minimalist this year which has been really exhausting for me.  I'll just write some brief thoughts to accompany each photo.

Made the drive out with my parents and my sister's family.  We found a local park in Ohio - the parking area did fill up but it wasn't overwhelming crowds like I remember from when I drove to Oregon to see the eclipse in 2017.  The infrastructure handled it.

My parents and I flew out to California to visit Grandpa and also get a crash course introduction to the Santa Anita racetrack thanks to my good friend Mark.  On a separate day Mark drove me out to see the beautiful spacious cathedral right in downtown.

And when visiting downtown LA, who can resist going to Amoeba!  I am not sure what to make of this photo, it's crazy busy but it does capture the essence of the place.  That's my friend Mark in the middle, and at the edge is what appears to be a Korean couple (judging by the clothes) checking out some Criterion movies.  Check out the Eraserhead poster on the back wall with googley eyes and a banana via Velvet Underground via Andy Warhol.

Yes, I found myself in Japan yet again!  I really need to get out and see more of the world, but it's always fun going back, and it's good to catch up with my friend there.

On this trip to Japan I brought my folks along for the ride.  Since they'd visited before, we were able to go a bit off the beaten path.  We took a train all the way up to Hokkaido (we like riding the train!) and rented a car.  You may think that's surprising for Japan, but once you get outside of the big cities it becomes a necessity, unless you want to wait for the slow infrequent trains out in more rural areas (I had some experience with that from a long time back).

So few photos this year.  My new year's resolution for 2025 is to take more photos and take some more trips!
