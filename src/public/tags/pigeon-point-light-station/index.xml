      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the year&amp;rsquo;s days shorten and their number dwindles, I have liked to sometimes take the initiative to sort through all the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken (with my &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; camera).  The eventual goal: to put together a sampling of the photos that stand out, sometimes for technical reasons, and sometimes for other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year I sadly didn&amp;rsquo;t get out with the camera as much as I have in previous years, which made this post much easier (no excuses this year!).  Less photos to sort through!  And much easier to pick out a small representative sampling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
