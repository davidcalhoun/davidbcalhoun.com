      <description>Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve been programming for a while, and you&amp;rsquo;re pretty comfortable using for loops to traverse Arrays. However, you know how untidy and complicated for loops can get, and you are interested in better approaches to keep the code clean. Enter map and reduce!
First steps with for loops Most folks find for loops powerful enough to achieve all they need when they need to process items in an Array. For example, say we have a simple list of items:</description>

      <title>async.parallel with a simple timeout (node.js)</title>

      <guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/async.parallel-with-a-simple-timeout-node.js/</guid>
      <description>A while back I had a need for a general timeout option for async.parallel and was surprised I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find much information about how to do it. I was using async.parallel to make a lot of REST calls in parallel, but one of them was getting blocked by a firewall, resulting in an eventual timeout minutes later.
One option was to specify a shorter timeout for each individual REST call, including the one causing the problem.</description>

      <title>What is AMD, CommonJS, and UMD?</title>

      <description>Intro Over the years there&amp;rsquo;s been a steadily increasing ecosystem of JavaScript components to choose from. The sheer amount of choices is fantastic, but this also infamously presents a difficulty when components are mixed-and-matched. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too long for budding developers to find out that not all components are built to play nicely together.
To address these issues, the competing module specs AMD and CommonJS have appeared on the scene, allowing developers to write their code in an agreed-upon sandboxed and modularized way, so as not to &amp;ldquo;pollute the ecosystem&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Introducing Negative Scroll Blur (for browsers that support CSS filters)</title>

Demo
Just for fun, I wanted to reproduce a cool but completely superfluous UI I saw in the updated Foursquare app recently. Basically, when the user tries to scroll past the upper bound of the app/page, the header image becomes blurred.
We can do the same thing on the web by listening for negative scroll and then using (abusing?</description>

The quizzes get more and more difficult, and they present a nice challenge if you fear your skills are getting rusty. Give it an honest try first, then come back here if you get seriously, honestly stuck. Try to do it yourself!

      <description>The other day I glanced at a classmate using Baidu to perform an image search and was impressed with their presentation:

Note the nice big images and the lack of margins around images. After seeing this presentation, I realized that the common approach of adding margins around images is pretty unnecessary.
I also noticed that the images are a variety of sizes, leading to a less sterile experience. There&amp;rsquo;s surely some clever math going on behind the scenes here to make sure the images appear &amp;ldquo;justified&amp;rdquo; (to use a word from the recent Flickr redesign).</description>

      <description>Introduction UPDATE 2016: this appears to have even less support than before, and it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended to be used on a production site. Use a helper JS library instead.
(check out the Demo)
A while back I had a bit of a field day messing around with input type=&amp;ldquo;range&amp;rdquo;, trying to replicate the &amp;ldquo;unlock slider&amp;rdquo; on iOS using CSS, targeting special WebKit-only CSS pseudoelements such as webkit-slider-thumb.
Well, now I&amp;rsquo;m at it again, this time with a much simpler use case, trying to implement a custom &amp;ldquo;clear&amp;rdquo; button on search field inputs (note that this only works on input type=&amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo;):</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a flurry of response to this article, entitled &amp;ldquo;What’s next for mobile now that adaptive design has failed?&amp;quot;.
There&amp;rsquo;s many problems with this article, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know where to start.
I will admit that defenders of responsive design have come out of the woodwork in trashing this article, but I suppose I count myself among them, being a proponent of responsive design. I still see the web heading that direction, and I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t see it heading in the direction the author of the article has described.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 2/25/2013 As of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s update last year, it appears that many of the old Facebook URL schemes are no longer working&amp;hellip;. So this post looks to be outdated and useless already&amp;hellip; :)
The skinny Copy this code:
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;fb://publish/profile/me?text=foo&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Post to Facebook&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  {:lang=&amp;ldquo;html&amp;rdquo;}
Explanation As you may know, Facebook has a URL scheme
fb://  which seems to be mainly used by native developers. What most folks don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that it&amp;rsquo;s just a URL scheme, like http://, and that we can use it within our mobile browsers!</description>

      <guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2011/mobile-performance-manifesto/</guid>
      <description>Earlier this year I gave a talk (slides) outlining the latest and greatest in mobile performance, including a bit of my own unscientific research into carrier latency and bandwidth thanks to boomerang.js.
I realized that interest in mobile performance has exploded recently, especially with Steve Souders announcing his focus on mobile, and I thought it was time for an update, this time in blog form. Also, my old slides have been somewhat embarrassing.</description>

      <description>Introduction Ever since Steve Souders started evangelizing web performance, it&amp;rsquo;s been pounded into our heads that extra HTTP requests add a lot of additional overhead, and that we should combine them if possible to dramatically decrease the load time of our web pages.
The practical implication of this has been to combine our JavaScript and CSS files, which is relatively easy and straightforward, but the harder question has been what to do with images.</description>

Russian translation thanks to Yevgeniy Pyastolov
This is madness! This&amp;hellip; is&amp;hellip; JavaScript! In JavaScript, there&amp;rsquo;s many different ways of doing something. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. To the newcomer this is definitely a bad thing, as it means not only more things to learn, but more little caveats and more places to go wrong. And so it is with declaring functions!</description>

It looks like there&amp;rsquo;s finally some major improvements in mobile Safari, some of which I&amp;rsquo;ve found below on my &amp;ldquo;first glance&amp;rdquo; after downloading the SDK. Chime in if you find anything yourself!
Bad news first Much to my disappointment, browser-based file uploads are still not supported (input type=&amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo;), even though they have been supported on Android since version 2.</description>

(why does Twitter make it so hard? What did RSS ever do to it?)

From your browser you can now upload pictures and videos from the camera as well as sounds from the microphone. The returned data should be available to manipulate via the File API (although I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet tested this).

      <description>In general it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to check for the existence of something before blindly using it by faith and hoping it works. There are various times during the execution of scripts when a variable may not be defined, it may be null, or it might be an empty string. These are three things that are easily conflated. A good way to look at this is thinking of these as having increasing levels of existence (getting a bit philosophical here for a moment&amp;hellip;):</description>

      <description>(check out the live demo)
Introduction After reading &amp;ldquo;What the Heck is Shadow DOM?&amp;quot; I was inspired to see how far I could style the &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;range&amp;quot;&amp;gt; element. Pretty far, as it turns out!
My goal was to change the input&amp;rsquo;s default appearance:
To the visual appearance of the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s unlock slider:
As far as I can tell, only WebKit-based browsers and Opera have implemented input type=range. Mobile Safari hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented it as of iOS 4.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an overwhelming amount of information being pumped out of the JavaScript community each week, but how do you keep up with it? Here&amp;rsquo;s some sources to keep you busy.
Twitter This merits a category of its own. This has replaced the RSS reader for a lot of folks, or at the very least supplemented it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently recommended Nathan Smith&amp;rsquo;s list of JavaScript folks. When I&amp;rsquo;m diligent, I keep up with this several times a week and favorite items from the feed to be considered for inclusion in that week&amp;rsquo;s JSMag Blog update.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what happens when your interface completely relies on JavaScript. There&amp;rsquo;s code with translated mojibake of some sort which caused the JavaScript to break. The code wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a try-catch block, so it caused all of the code on the page to fail, thus presenting me with the only part of the screen that wasn&amp;rsquo;t generated by JavaScript: the completely useless header.
Where&amp;rsquo;s the tweets!?</description>

      <title>How to spot outdated JavaScript</title>

      <guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2011/how-to-spot-outdated-javascript/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Those that are just setting out to learn JavaScript are typically overwhelmed by the amount of online resources to be found about learning JavaScript. Not only this, but every webpage visited presents a potential learning opportunity just by inspecting the source.
However, not all resources are guaranteed to be up-to-date. JavaScript has been around for over a decade, and coding standards have changed drastically over time. While a code snippet may still work in today&amp;rsquo;s browsers, you may unknowingly be using an outdated practice that might eventually lead to a bit of embarrassment.</description>

      <description>Intro There have been many attempts to answer this question in a succinct way, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been satisfied by them. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt at a (relatively) concise explanation.
This is adapted from a reply I posted on reddit which people seemed to have found useful.
Broad definition Normally when people talk about closures in JavaScript, they&amp;rsquo;re talking about methods and properties that outlive the scope of their original function (more on that in a second), but actually the definition is a bit broader.</description>

      <description>Introduction When people started to learn about the HTML5 doctype, they kind of freaked out a little, not knowing how older browsers would handle it. A post by Dustin Diaz prompted me to test out how pages rendered (in QuirksMode or Standards Mode) with a little help from document.compatMode, and I found that surprisingly every browser rendered in Standards Mode with the new doctype. In other words, no need to worry!</description>

      <description>General word of caution: not all of these HTML5 simplifications are compatible with older browsers. Test it for yourself before implementing!

      <description>The problem On the desktop we&amp;rsquo;re quite privileged to have nice debugging tools such as Firebug and Web Inspector in Webkit-based browsers. But when it comes to mobile, debugging JavaScript with console.log.
isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as easy.
Probably the best available tool on mobile at the moment is mobile Safari&amp;rsquo;s console, which looks like the following when enabled (Settings -&amp;gt; Safari -&amp;gt; Developer -&amp;gt; Debug Console):

      <description>Introduction A little while back this post made the rounds, which took us on a journey through some of the new features introduced in the browser in Android 2.2 Froyo. Among the most overlooked features are the file upload functionality (you can upload photos from your browser now! But we&amp;rsquo;re still waiting on iPhone to support this&amp;hellip;) and a little-known JavaScript addition to the Browser Object Model (BOM) in the form of navigator.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you read part 4 of this series, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that because of the variety of screen sizes, the best way to develop for mobile is to develop fluid layouts that take 100% of the available space on the screen.
What you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t think of is that there&amp;rsquo;s different screen widths even on the same device! This is due to screen orientation. And when the user changes the screen orientation, stuff may break (hey, it&amp;rsquo;s not a perfect world).</description>

      <description>I stumbled across this concept recently and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share it, because I don&amp;rsquo;t generally see this pattern being used. More importantly, I also share test results that show that maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not always a good idea to use this pattern&amp;hellip;
The problem with Switch statements The basic switch statement in JavaScript looks something like this:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  var foo = &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;; switch(foo) { case &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;: break; case &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;: break; case &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;: break; default: }   So what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this?</description>

      <description>The frontend engineer lives at the intersection between design and engineering, and this is perhaps nowhere more true than in the world of mobile. In order to make a usable desktop website, an engineer must have at least some sense of design, and fortunately a lot of this has been standardized over the years. But the world of mobile is full of more unknowns, and the field is changing rapidly, especially lately from the shift away from older feature phones to the focus on smartphones.</description>

      <description>A button is something that seems to be made just for mobile: it’s designed to be big and easy to activate, as opposed to small and harder to activate, like normal text links. This seems ideal for a mobile devices, which have a small display area and whose form of input is a person’s (relatively) fat finger interacting with the screen. Contrast this with the desktop, where the display area is much larger and the input device, the mouse, is a much more highly refined and sensitive pointing device.</description>

      <description>Tools of the trade You’re no mobile developer unless you have the tools to develop on mobile! And while it’s good to own at least one of the smartphones you’re developing on, it’s probably unrealistic to think that you’re going to go out of your way to buy several other unlocked smartphones just to test with. So you should have the next best thing: an SDK!
But an SDK is just one of the tools of the trade.</description>

      <description>With CSS there are always various ways to accomplish something. After reading this short tidbit, you should be familiar with the various ways of controlling the size of an element’s padding, border, and margin, and you should know what the handy “clockwork” tip is, and how it will be useful to remember when you’re putting your CSS into practice.
Equal values on all four sides If all four values (top, right, bottom, and left) are equal, then you simply write the following:</description>

      <description>In case you hadn’t seen it yet, John Resig was kind enough to stop by Yahoo! for the December Bayjax meetup. Here’s the video:
 Usually developers are more interested in just getting the dang code to work, and as a result actual the testing and maintenance of JavaScript isn’t talked about too much, so I’m sure this will be new territory for many developers. And since it’s John Resig speaking, there was of course a bit about using TestSwarm, a testing distributed framework-agnostic automated testing tool (that’s a mouthful!</description>

      <title>Ways of passing data to functions in JavaScript</title>

      <description>Passing data is quite important in functional programming languages like JavaScript. When there are multiple functions (which is most of the time), there needs to be a way to pass data between the functions. This is done by passing values in parenthesis: myFunction(myData). Even when there is no data to be passed, we still have to declare and execute functions by using parenthesis: myFunction().
Simple Passing I&amp;rsquo;ve already referred to the common method of passing data.</description>

      <title>IE Mobile 6.12 problem: browser ignores the specificity of CSS display styles</title>

      <description>UPDATE: I found that the problem is actually that inline-block is completely unsupported in this version of IE Mobile, and is likely also unsupported in IE Mobile 7, which is also based on IE4. This is in contrast to desktop IE6, where inline-block is supported on elements that are natively inline (span, em, etc.).
Just found this today, for what it’s worth. If you’re unlucky enough to be working with older Windows Mobile phones you have probably realized that the browser is based on IE6, which all the desktop web developers notoriously complain about constantly.</description>
