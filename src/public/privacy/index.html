</hgroup>

<h2>Information I may receive from third parties</h2>
<p>I may receive information about you from third parties.  For example, if you choose to login through Twitter in order to post a comment, linking your account to davidbcalhoun.com, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to davidbcalhoun.com. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.</p>

<p>You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them davidbcalhoun.com. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.</p>

<h2>Analytics information</h2>
<p>I may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. I collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>

<h2>Cookies information</h2>

<p>When you visit davidbcalhoun.com, I may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets davidbcalhoun.com help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to me about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service). A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can configure your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>

<h2>Log file information</h2>

<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>

<h2>Sharing of Your Information</h2>

If you are using a third-party website or service (like Facebook, Google groups, or an IRC chatroom) and you allow such a third-party access to you User Content you do so at your own risk.
