      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-warning-this-is-an-old-article-and-may-include-information-thats-out-of-date-&#34;&gt;⚠️ Warning: this is an old article and may include information that&amp;rsquo;s out of date. ⚠️&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A button is something that seems to be made just for mobile: it’s designed to be big and easy to activate, as opposed to small and harder to activate, like normal text links. This seems ideal for a mobile devices, which have a small display area and whose form of input is a person’s (relatively) fat finger interacting with the screen. Contrast this with the desktop, where the display area is much larger and the input device, the mouse, is a much more highly refined and sensitive pointing device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
