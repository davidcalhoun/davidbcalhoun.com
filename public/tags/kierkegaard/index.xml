      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Soren Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(this excerpt is from Provocations, excerpts from Kierkegaard, Plough)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a wood dove. It had its nest in the fearsome forest, where wonder and apprehension dwelt together, among the erect, lonely trees. But nearby, where the smoke rises up from the farmer”s house, lived some tame doves. The wood dove would often meet a pair of these. He would sit on a branch that stretched out over the farmyard, not far from the two tame doves on the ridge of the roof. One day they were talking together about how things were going and about making a living. The wood dove said, “Up until now I have made my living by letting each day have its own troubles, and in that way I get through life just fine.” The tame dove, not without preening itself, answered: “No, we manage differently; with us, that is with the rich farmer with whom we live, our future is secure. At harvest time, my mate and I sit up on the roof and watch. The farmer brings in so many loads of corn that I know we are secure for a very long time. We two are well provided for and have our guaranteed security.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
