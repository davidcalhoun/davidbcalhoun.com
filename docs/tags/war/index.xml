      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Casablanca more than a few times, and it&amp;rsquo;s become one of my favorite films. For this review I got to experience it in 35mm at the wonderful nearby Stanford Theatre.&#xA;But that&amp;rsquo;s not how I first experienced it. I first watched it at home and half paid attention to it. A lot of the movie was lost on me and I thought it was overrated, just ok, and not that great.</description>
