      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before setting off on my current trip, I wanted to give myself at least one &amp;ldquo;photo assignment&amp;rdquo;: some goal I could aim to accomplish by pretending like I&amp;rsquo;d been given an assignment by some employer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the first of what I hope will be many.  The assignment here is to try to capture the atmosphere of eastern Kyoto&amp;rsquo;s traditional streets at night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple of things I had to plan for: Kyoto is a bit far from my hostel in Osaka, so I made sure to make a day trip out of it.  Also, I wanted preferably a somewhat rainy day, which would make the ground more reflective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
