      <description>Intro 2020 is a year that had a nice ring to it, conjuring up images of &amp;ldquo;20/20 vision&amp;rdquo; and whatnot, but it turned out to be a bit misleading&amp;hellip; And for some of us it has been much harder. Much has been said and much will continue to be written about this year, but despite circumstances we have tried to pull through.&#xA;For me, this year was a year of finally moving the last of my things out of California, and new beginnings: starting a new job working remotely from a new apartment in North Carolina, a place I have been interested in living in for a while.</description>
