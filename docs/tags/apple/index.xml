      <description>&lt;p&gt;After work today, I stopped by the old bustling Apple Store in Palo Alto. I was there for a bit of a peek at what my next blank check to Apple would bring me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was between tables going back and forth between the updated MacBook Pro (non-retina) and the Retina MacBook Pro and came away with some initial impressions. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find these sort of &amp;ldquo;impartial&amp;rdquo; impressions elsewhere, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d record these impressions for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
