      <description>2023 has been a stressful and hard year, and I have a sneaking suspicion this is a preview of even harder years on my path ahead. I am finding myself more tired and having really poor sleep quality, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I see things improving but I am cautiously optimisitic. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to keep positive by remembering my blessings as best I can, and this year came with a lot of blessings for sure.</description>
