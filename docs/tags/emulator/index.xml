      <description>⚠️ Warning: this is an old article and may include information that&amp;rsquo;s out of date. ⚠️ Apparently it’s no longer possible to easily download Android versions 2.0 and 2.0.1 from the AVD Manager. I noticed this problem when I got a new machine and had to install everything from scratch. In the future I suspect even more AVDs will be made obsolete, so this solution also applies to them.
Why would you want to install obsolete AVDs?</description>

      <description>⚠️ Warning: this is an old article and may include information that&amp;rsquo;s out of date. ⚠️ Tools of the trade You’re no mobile developer unless you have the tools to develop on mobile! And while it’s good to own at least one of the smartphones you’re developing on, it’s probably unrealistic to think that you’re going to go out of your way to buy several other unlocked smartphones just to test with.</description>
