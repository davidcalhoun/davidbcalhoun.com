      <description>When the year&amp;rsquo;s days shorten and their number dwindles, I have liked to sometimes take the initiative to sort through all the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken (with my &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; camera). The eventual goal: to put together a sampling of the photos that stand out, sometimes for technical reasons, and sometimes for other reasons.&#xA;This year I sadly didn&amp;rsquo;t get out with the camera as much as I have in previous years, which made this post much easier (no excuses this year!</description>

The temperatures are dropping up here in the mountains of Big Bear, especially at night, when it&amp;rsquo;s now approaching freezing or below. A surprising number of trees are changing colors. I say surprising because this is California, after all, and we don&amp;rsquo;t usually see fall colors unless we know where to look.&#xA;The aspens are of course doing their thing and changing from green to yellow, and there are other surprising splashes of red and orange as I drive through the neighborhood.</description>
