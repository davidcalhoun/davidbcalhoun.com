      <title>Video: Spring in Kyoto Revisited</title>

      <description>Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag.  --  A while back I posted an old video I made of Spring in Kyoto, but the audio track was removed by YouTube. So I&amp;rsquo;m self-hosting it here now, and reposting to revisit the memories!
I really enjoy the atmosphere in this video, and I wish I made more videos like them. I used my Canon 7D for a lot of the video, but I wish it was shot in RAW video and on a tripod, as a lot of the detail was lost and a lot of the video ended up &amp;ldquo;wobbly&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Hello friends! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while without an update.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working more and more on my photography endeavors, which includes building up a YouTube channel to document my travels and also my learnings. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it&amp;rsquo;s interesting and useful enough, especially for other aspiring photographers.
This year is definitely shaping up to be a year of travelling, and I&amp;rsquo;d also like to keep a blog of photos and such, so I&amp;rsquo;m working to get a separate photography blog setup at my photography website.</description>

      <title>The roads of Indonesia</title>

      <description>The biggest culture shock of Indonesia had to be the bathroom facilities, but that&amp;rsquo;s best saved for another post. The second biggest culture shock had to be the roads, and the drivers on them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to any third world Asian country before, so the idea of seeing roads dominated by scooters and motorcycles was really a foreign concept to me. This also meant that the style of driving is way different.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Japan for the past few weeks, and have been lazy about updating my blog, which I promised to do! I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy sorting through pictures!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a video update from where I&amp;rsquo;ll be staying long term at a place called the Banana House:</description>

      <description>This is just a fun little video demo into the inner workings of today&amp;rsquo;s Google Doodle. Nothing you can&amp;rsquo;t do yourself with Firebug or Web Inspector (built into WebKit browsers such as Safari and Chrome). But I liked this doodle so much, I wanted to talk about it!

      <description>In case you hadn’t seen it yet, John Resig was kind enough to stop by Yahoo! for the December Bayjax meetup. Here’s the video:
 Usually developers are more interested in just getting the dang code to work, and as a result actual the testing and maintenance of JavaScript isn’t talked about too much, so I’m sure this will be new territory for many developers. And since it’s John Resig speaking, there was of course a bit about using TestSwarm, a testing distributed framework-agnostic automated testing tool (that’s a mouthful!</description>
