      <description>(this is a copy of a letter which I&amp;rsquo;ve sent to various representatives in government)&#xA;As a concerned citizen, I know you understand that I must occasionally voice my concern through letters such as this. My hope is that you will honestly consider my claims and take action on my part. I honestly appreciate you taking your time to seriously consider this letter.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m writing to you today specifically in response to abuses by the NSA overstepping its bounds.</description>

      <description>The real shame about NSA/PRISM is that everyone will forget about it next week or next month. Just like we forgot about Trapwire and other endless abuses in the name of protecting society.&#xA;The US is now a nation too mentally castrated to do anything about these obvious constitutional abuses. Why are we only capable of short-lived and impotent protest attempts like Occupy? How did we get to be so sedated through this anesthesia of modern consumerism and entertainment?</description>
