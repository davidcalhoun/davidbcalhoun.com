      <description>&lt;p&gt;In many ways this has been a strange and wonderful year, probably my most favorite year of my life to date.  I traveled to Japan on a great flight deal, I hiked more than 1100 miles of the Appalachian Trail, and I drove across the USA on two (!) cross-country road trips, the latter a wonderful solo trip where I took my time photographing and visiting wonderful parks and museums.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
