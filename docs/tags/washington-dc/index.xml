      <description>2023 has been a stressful and hard year, and I have a sneaking suspicion this is a preview of even harder years on my path ahead. I am finding myself more tired and having really poor sleep quality, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I see things improving but I am cautiously optimisitic. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to keep positive by remembering my blessings as best I can, and this year came with a lot of blessings for sure.</description>

      <description>Intro Despite the continuing COVID-19 pandemic this year, I am grateful I was able to travel a bit. Two separate flights to California and a few road trips. While trying to keep as safe as possible, and being lucky so far not to have symptoms of COVID over this two year period (at the moment anyway&amp;hellip;).&#xA;One of my favorite hiking spots this year was the Williamson Preserve, which is a long path of hiking and biking trails that was recently converted from farmland.</description>
