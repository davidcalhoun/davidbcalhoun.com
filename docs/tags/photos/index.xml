      <description>2023 has been a stressful and hard year, and I have a sneaking suspicion this is a preview of even harder years on my path ahead. I am finding myself more tired and having really poor sleep quality, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I see things improving but I am cautiously optimisitic. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to keep positive by remembering my blessings as best I can, and this year came with a lot of blessings for sure.</description>

      <description>Another year, another year in photos! I&amp;rsquo;m thankful for things almost returning to normal now after the pandemic. I was able to travel to Ireland with my buddy Mark, and I was also able to get in a few domestic trips as well!&#xA;I didn&amp;rsquo;t get my camera out and about as much as I wanted, but I still have a few picks. Seems I&amp;rsquo;m getting more interested in bird and butterfly photography&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Intro Despite the continuing COVID-19 pandemic this year, I am grateful I was able to travel a bit. Two separate flights to California and a few road trips. While trying to keep as safe as possible, and being lucky so far not to have symptoms of COVID over this two year period (at the moment anyway&amp;hellip;).&#xA;One of my favorite hiking spots this year was the Williamson Preserve, which is a long path of hiking and biking trails that was recently converted from farmland.</description>

      <description>Intro 2020 is a year that had a nice ring to it, conjuring up images of &amp;ldquo;20/20 vision&amp;rdquo; and whatnot, but it turned out to be a bit misleading&amp;hellip; And for some of us it has been much harder. Much has been said and much will continue to be written about this year, but despite circumstances we have tried to pull through.&#xA;For me, this year was a year of finally moving the last of my things out of California, and new beginnings: starting a new job working remotely from a new apartment in North Carolina, a place I have been interested in living in for a while.</description>

      <description>The roof of the main shrine (拝殿) at Kitano Tenmangu. Almost a year ago now I was lucky to be able to go back to my old stomping grounds in Kyoto, where I once studied Japanese in the hopes of maybe learning enough of the language to enroll in a university there to continue my studies in philosophy, perhaps being able to one day be another &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; philosopher to walk along the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Path.</description>

      <description>In many ways this has been a strange and wonderful year, probably my most favorite year of my life to date. I traveled to Japan on a great flight deal, I hiked more than 1100 miles of the Appalachian Trail, and I drove across the USA on two (!) cross-country road trips, the latter a wonderful solo trip where I took my time photographing and visiting wonderful parks and museums.</description>

      <description>When the year&amp;rsquo;s days shorten and their number dwindles, I have liked to sometimes take the initiative to sort through all the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken (with my &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; camera). The eventual goal: to put together a sampling of the photos that stand out, sometimes for technical reasons, and sometimes for other reasons.&#xA;This year I sadly didn&amp;rsquo;t get out with the camera as much as I have in previous years, which made this post much easier (no excuses this year!</description>

      <description>A few years back I put together my favorite photos of the year (see it: part one and part two). I decided to resurrect the tradition, and I hope to keep it going in the coming years!&#xA;Onto the pics!&#xA;February I visited Yosemite twice, first by myself and later with my friend Kevin.&#xA;Night sky from Yosemite For this shot I drove to the empty Bridalveil Falls parking lot and placed an LED lantern in the middle of the parking lot, then shot straight up.</description>

      <description>A few years back I had the opportunity to visit New Orleans in the spring with my friend. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve returned with my parents to visit in the fall!&#xA;My mom had recently expressed a desire to do more travelling while still physically able, which kicked off creating a list of places to visit, and ultimately booking this first trip. Hopefully the first of many to come. She asked if I wanted to tag along, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass up another visit to the city.</description>

      <description>I was just putting together this article and these photos on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve when I glanced and the clock and noticed I was already four minutes into 2015. Oops!&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s the second-parter for my favorite photo from 2014. Also be sure to check out the first part.&#xA;July Yuka was still here in early July, just in time to see Fourth of July fireworks at Big Bear Lake, California, before she had to go back to Japan.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s nearing the year&amp;rsquo;s end, so of course this means a somewhat sentimental blog post from me. I was thinking of a &amp;ldquo;resolutions/goals&amp;rdquo; type post, but I decided against it. Instead here&amp;rsquo;s something more entertaining: my favorite photos from the past year! Note that these aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily my best, just my favorites.&#xA;Finding these is also a little bit of housekeeping for me and my photos. It forces me to sort the gigabytes and gigabytes of RAW photos I was casually dumping onto drives the entire year.</description>
