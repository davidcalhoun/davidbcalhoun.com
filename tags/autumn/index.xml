The eventual goal: to put together a sampling of the photos that stand out, sometimes for technical reasons, and sometimes for other reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year I sadly didn&amp;rsquo;t get out with the camera as much as I have in previous years, which made this post much easier (no excuses this year!). Less photos to sort through! And much easier to pick out a small representative sampling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Time for autumn adventures</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/time-for-autumn-adventures/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2016 16:06:18 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/time-for-autumn-adventures/</guid><description>&lt;figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center">

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s autumn again. The temperatures are dropping up here in the mountains of Big Bear, especially at night, when it&amp;rsquo;s now approaching freezing or below. A surprising number of trees are changing colors. I say surprising because this is California, after all, and we don&amp;rsquo;t usually see fall colors unless we know where to look.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aspens are of course doing their thing and changing from green to yellow, and there are other surprising splashes of red and orange as I drive through the neighborhood. So it&amp;rsquo;s getting cold and the colors are changing - sounds like a pretty typical autumn, right?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
