The story isn&amp;rsquo;t strong, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be and it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be. It&amp;rsquo;s just there as a sort of skeleton to hang all the skits on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a movie, this feels to me to be strangely out of place in the top 100 movies, maybe because it&amp;rsquo;s such a low budget production. But being low budget is also part of its charm and humor. It fits easily into the top 100 &lt;em>comedy&lt;/em> movies of all time however.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
