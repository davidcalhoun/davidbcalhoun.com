&lt;p>My sister and I were lucky enough to have Disneyland annual passports growing up (thank you, mom and dad!). I remember the prices being super low in general, like in the $20 range with a Southern California discount for single tickets, and I thought maybe my memory was deceiving me until I looked up the historical prices. In 1995 the cost of an adult ticket without the SoCal discount was $33, which puts the costs about where I remember them. That is about $55 in 2020 dollars.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
