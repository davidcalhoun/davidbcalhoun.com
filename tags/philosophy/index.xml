Is it possible that our early education makes us in a way incorrigible to any future correction?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A long time ago I lived thousands of miles away from home in Japan, and several times I had a craving for comfort foods that I grew up with. Which were of course hard to come by in this new land I was living in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lessons in Gratefulness</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2021/lessons-in-gratefulness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2021/lessons-in-gratefulness/</guid><description>&lt;p>We all have times in life when we were forced to learn lessons the hard way, often in situations where we were absolutely humbled. A lot of these happen early on in childhood, but even so, I find that there are some lessons I am still learning to this day. I am trying to improve, trying to get better constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these childhood lessons for me was a year when my family was tight on money and was forced to combine Christmas with a mid-year back-to-school resupply. It was a really bitter pill for my sister and I to swallow. Most of our gifts were stationary items like bags of rubber bands, Post-Its, staplers and packs of staples, some of which I&amp;rsquo;m still finding unused in boxes to this day. I think we were told beforehand not to get our hopes up for that years&amp;rsquo; gifts, and that cash was tight. Knowing what to expect (or in this case what &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> to expect) helped soften the blow a bit, but it was still a huge challenge to receive these items gratefully. I vaguely remember trying the best I could to bottle my emotions, but it was difficult. It was impossible to convey at the time, but it was just one of many of life&amp;rsquo;s disappointments, something we had better get used to early on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Death on the Appalachian Trail</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2020/thoughts-on-death-on-the-appalachian-trail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2020/thoughts-on-death-on-the-appalachian-trail/</guid><description>&lt;figure itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center landscape">

&lt;p>My former coworker had hiked the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Camino de Santiago&lt;/a>, a long pilgrimage trail in Spain, and I told her I wanted to hike the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Appalachian Trail&lt;/a> and was looking for all the insight I could get. One thing she told me was that hiking was such a raw and real experience, &lt;strong>something so different from our world steeped in the abstract&lt;/strong>. I understood what she said, or at least thought I did, and agreed with her sentiments. I found out later that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand. Rather, I understood, but not in a personal, experiental way. I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand in a way that really &amp;ldquo;clicked&amp;rdquo; with my soul.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Behold the Birds of the Air (Soren Kierkegaard)</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2017/behold-the-birds-of-the-air-soren-kierkegaard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2017 13:29:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2017/behold-the-birds-of-the-air-soren-kierkegaard/</guid><description>&lt;p>From Soren Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(this excerpt is from Provocations, excerpts from Kierkegaard, Plough)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once upon a time there was a wood dove. It had its nest in the fearsome forest, where wonder and apprehension dwelt together, among the erect, lonely trees. But nearby, where the smoke rises up from the farmer”s house, lived some tame doves. The wood dove would often meet a pair of these. He would sit on a branch that stretched out over the farmyard, not far from the two tame doves on the ridge of the roof. One day they were talking together about how things were going and about making a living. The wood dove said, “Up until now I have made my living by letting each day have its own troubles, and in that way I get through life just fine.” The tame dove, not without preening itself, answered: “No, we manage differently; with us, that is with the rich farmer with whom we live, our future is secure. At harvest time, my mate and I sit up on the roof and watch. The farmer brings in so many loads of corn that I know we are secure for a very long time. We two are well provided for and have our guaranteed security.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stifling Laughter in Distant Places</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2017/stifling-laughter-in-distant-places/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2017 20:10:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2017/stifling-laughter-in-distant-places/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="new-cultures">New Cultures&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first days of traveling usually involves laughing at the quaint and unusual customs of another culture. That sounds close-minded, because in many cases it probably is. But it&amp;rsquo;s something we all do, of course including yours truly. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a coping mechanism - laughing at things in the face of difficulties and differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be fair, we&amp;rsquo;re thinking creatures, and as such it&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard for us not to draw comparisons with our own home city and culture. Especially when we spot things that we consider outdated in our own culture. Our reaction may be disgust (&amp;ldquo;Fax machines?! Didn&amp;rsquo;t those go extinct in the 90s?!&amp;rdquo;) or nostalgia (&amp;ldquo;Ahh decent customer service - it&amp;rsquo;s been way too long&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beginning thoughts on the idea of a Great American Road Trip</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2017/beginning-thoughts-on-the-idea-of-a-great-american-road-trip/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 22:35:47 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2017/beginning-thoughts-on-the-idea-of-a-great-american-road-trip/</guid><description>&lt;p>The idea of a trip across the United States has become somewhat of an American institution. Something like a New American Dream, this one maybe a bit more accessible than that house, happy life, and nuclear family with 2.5 kids.

For most folks this comes as a shock, as we have all thought the chances of this happening were slim. Comedians chided him on and dared him to run. Even President Obama who continually roasted him &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mzJhvC-8E">at the White House Correspondents&amp;rsquo; Dinner in 2011&lt;/a>, arguably the defining moment when Trump became driven to run for President (&amp;ldquo;He certainly would bring some change to the White House&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quine and Heidegger: Against Reductionism</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/quine-and-heidegger-against-reductionism/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2016 22:15:05 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/quine-and-heidegger-against-reductionism/</guid><description>&lt;meta itemprop="mainEntityOfPage" content="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism">
&lt;p>Earlier this year I had the opportunity to attend my first philosophy class in about a decade. The class was on the infamous philosopher Martin Heidegger, and the course was taught at Stanford University by Forrest Hartman (PHI 98: An Introduction to Martin Heidegger (Spring 2016)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heidegger is famous for being obscure and notoriously difficult to read, but I believe I made some headway in what turned out to be a very interesting philosophy. Most interestingly, though Heidegger is considered to be a &amp;ldquo;continental&amp;rdquo; philosophy, I found some common ground with Quine, who is considered to be an &amp;ldquo;analytical&amp;rdquo; philosophy, supposedly in a diametrically opposed camp.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Junk Food, Junk Politics, Junk TV, Junk Body, Junk Mind, Junk Truth</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/junk-food-junk-politics-junk-tv-junk-body-junk-mind-junk-truth/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2016 17:06:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/junk-food-junk-politics-junk-tv-junk-body-junk-mind-junk-truth/</guid><description>&lt;p>We Americans believe we have a right to be the way we want to be, which includes being lazy physically and intellectually.

&lt;p>Andre: OK. Yes, we are bored. We&amp;rsquo;re all bored now. But has it ever occurred to you, Wally, that the process that creates this boredom that we see in the world now may very well be a self-perpetuating, unconscious form of brainwashing, created by a world totalitarian government based on money, and that all of this is much more dangerous than one thinks?

&lt;p>Even while exercising I could feel me asking myself nagging questions. Why am I working out? What&amp;rsquo;s the goal? What&amp;rsquo;s the point of keeping your body healthy if you don&amp;rsquo;t even know where you&amp;rsquo;re going?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are important questions, but not the right questions when I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a somewhat eye-opening and challenging piece for various reasons, because it challenges some things I thought I had a good grasp of.  Particularly the repeated shooting-down in the essay of people who claim it&amp;rsquo;s how the medium is used that matters, not the medium itself.  McCluhan disagrees with this by constantly impressing upon the reader not only that the medium and content are inseparable and come as a whole package, but that there is really no distinction to be made between content and medium.  It&amp;rsquo;s one medium nicely packaged in another medium.  This is the meaning of &amp;ldquo;the medium is the message&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Forms of Escapism</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/forms-of-escapism/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/forms-of-escapism/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking lately that the fates of so many are motivated by, in a word, escapism. Including my own fate. These are folks whose lives seem quite different on first glance, but turn out to be similar. We can&amp;rsquo;t escape some of our basic human nature after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-preservationist">The Preservationist&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>These are folks who, for lack of a better term, wish to preserve a &amp;ldquo;simpler time&amp;rdquo;. They are people such as Thoreau, who wanted a return to simpler times and aspired to self-sufficiency (or an approximation, in any case). They are folks such as the Amish, who saw no good in the coming changes, and decided to create an ideal society in the form of a living time capsule.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A theory of leisure time, choice, and happiness</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/a-theory-of-leisure-time-choice-and-happiness/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/a-theory-of-leisure-time-choice-and-happiness/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is finally the end of my first week in Japanese language school here in Kyoto. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a long week, with the most studying I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done in my life. We&amp;rsquo;ve gone through nine chapters in a week, and just Friday received two more books for learning Kanji. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn our first 50 Kanji in a week, alongside the rest of our classes. I already know some words here and there, but for the most part, much of what we&amp;rsquo;ve just learned is a blur, which is forcing me to use almost all of my free time in running to catch up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Descartes on building software frameworks</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/descartes-on-building-software-frameworks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/descartes-on-building-software-frameworks/</guid><description>&lt;figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center">

&lt;p>Years ago I read Descartes&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_the_Method">Discourse on Method&lt;/a> for what I found to be some of the more interesting philosophy courses of my college career: those of the history of modern philosophy. Modern philosophy technically starts with Descartes, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start, or to get re-acquainted with philosophy in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through the Discourse again, and have found it to be more interesting and relatable this time around (particularly about lessons learned while traveling, but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another post).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The life of your parents' choosing</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/the-life-of-your-parents-choosing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/the-life-of-your-parents-choosing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Several times I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;the religion of your parents&amp;rsquo; choosing&amp;rdquo;, used to scoff at adherents to various religions, as if they had no intelligent choice in the matter of their own beliefs. As the thought goes, religious standing (or lack thereof) should be a personal matter, one to be decided rationally (yes, there is such a thing as rational faith; to say otherwise is to label all religious people as fideists, which is a mistake) by individuals, apart from their social group if possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New direction (Developer Blog to Blog)</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/new-direction-developer-blog-to-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/new-direction-developer-blog-to-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve come to terms with the fact I need to try something new in my life - a true change in direction. I anticipate that this blog will take the same direction, so there will likely be less and less &amp;ldquo;developer&amp;rdquo; posts and more and more posts of me living this new path. (TLDR: unsubscribe now, probably!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why the change in direction? I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fun, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived a comfortable life where I really haven&amp;rsquo;t had to worry about money (yet), but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the hard way that buying &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t buy happiness. It&amp;rsquo;s trite and it&amp;rsquo;s something you always hear, but I guess it&amp;rsquo;s something you have to figure out for yourself, the hard way. I read Walden in high school and thought I&amp;rsquo;d learned from its lessons. But I re-read it recently and came away completely changed. I can get by with a lot less, and most importantly - with a more meaningful job that pays much less.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why is Philosophy still important?</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/why-is-philosophy-still-important/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/why-is-philosophy-still-important/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was posted on &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/sw0t2/why_is_philosophy_still_important/">reddit&lt;/a> recently, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d copy my response here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, just a quick introduction! There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of thought recently that philosophy is useless. The main arguments seem to be that&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>science has replaced any need for philosophy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>philosophy is a useless subject to study in college&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>For the latter argument, I recently recorded my thoughts, &lt;a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/b/2012-03-17-the-value-of-a-philosophy-degree.mp3">and you can hear them here&lt;/a>. For the first argument, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Web development, Silicon Valley rant</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2011/web-development-silicon-valley-rant/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2011/web-development-silicon-valley-rant/</guid><description>&lt;p>(if you didn&amp;rsquo;t read the title - warning: rant&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As far as web development goes, I guess I could rant on and on about the generalities. Of all things ephemeral. The lust after money, gadgets, and other worthless material crap that we use to stuff inside our oversized houses.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="self-worth-the-rich-man-and-the-poor-man">Self-worth: the rich man and the poor man&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For a long while there have been places in the world that view self-worth as largely tied to wealth.  No doubt there is more than just money, as even within the rich community there&amp;rsquo;s a distinction between the established rich and the &amp;ldquo;nouveau riche&amp;rdquo;, or the newly rich.  One is ranked higher than the other, but nonetheless the rich are themselves seen as being more important than the average person.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving yourself as a programmer versus as a human being</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2011/improving-yourself-as-a-programmer-versus-as-a-human-being/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2011/improving-yourself-as-a-programmer-versus-as-a-human-being/</guid><description>&lt;p>(OR &amp;ldquo;The Post In Which I Conflate Programming and Philosophy&amp;rdquo; OR &amp;ldquo;The Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Existentialist Crisis&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I woke up this morning to read Dmitry A. Soshnikov&amp;rsquo;s tweet:&lt;br>
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/DmitrySoshnikov/status/39356492058607616">&lt;img src="http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/two-programming-languages.png" alt="Have one-two langs in which you are a master and know professionally, and in addition, consider alternative langs.

&lt;p>While this seems like good advice for aspiring programmers, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think what this means for those who will buy into this. Us programmers have a keen ability to sit and focus on problems for extended periods of time, usually to the detriment of everything else around us. From the perspective of &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo;, we might as well be sitting in a basement somewhere playing World of Warcraft. Sure, programming is more productive, profitable, and surely not brainless, but at the end of the day we could still only be sitting in a basement somewhere. What I mean to say here is that we&amp;rsquo;re not actually living our actual lives doing these things.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
