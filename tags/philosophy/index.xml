      <title>Lessons in Gratefulness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all have times in life when we were forced to learn lessons the hard way, often in situations where we were absolutely humbled. A lot of these happen early on in childhood, but even so, I find that there are some lessons I am still learning to this day. I am trying to improve, trying to get better constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of these childhood lessons for me was a year when my family was tight on money and was forced to combine Christmas with a mid-year back-to-school resupply. It was a really bitter pill for my sister and I to swallow. Most of our gifts were stationary items like bags of rubber bands, Post-Its, staplers and packs of staples, some of which I&amp;rsquo;m still finding unused in boxes to this day. I think we were told beforehand not to get our hopes up for that years&amp;rsquo; gifts, and that cash was tight. Knowing what to expect (or in this case what &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to expect) helped soften the blow a bit, but it was still a huge challenge to receive these items gratefully. I vaguely remember trying the best I could to bottle my emotions, but it was difficult. It was impossible to convey at the time, but it was just one of many of life&amp;rsquo;s disappointments, something we had better get used to early on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This post has been a long time coming; I decided I wanted to write about this topic while I was still out hiking last year.  More than a few things made me think of it:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 &#xA;&lt;p&gt;My former coworker had hiked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Camino de Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, a long pilgrimage trail in Spain, and I told her I wanted to hike the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; and was looking for all the insight I could get. One thing she told me was that hiking was such a raw and real experience, &lt;strong&gt;something so different from our world steeped in the abstract&lt;/strong&gt;. I understood what she said, or at least thought I did, and agreed with her sentiments. I found out later that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand.  Rather, I understood, but not in a personal, experiental way. I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand in a way that really &amp;ldquo;clicked&amp;rdquo; with my soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Behold the Birds of the Air (Soren Kierkegaard)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Soren Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(this excerpt is from Provocations, excerpts from Kierkegaard, Plough)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a wood dove. It had its nest in the fearsome forest, where wonder and apprehension dwelt together, among the erect, lonely trees. But nearby, where the smoke rises up from the farmer”s house, lived some tame doves. The wood dove would often meet a pair of these. He would sit on a branch that stretched out over the farmyard, not far from the two tame doves on the ridge of the roof. One day they were talking together about how things were going and about making a living. The wood dove said, “Up until now I have made my living by letting each day have its own troubles, and in that way I get through life just fine.” The tame dove, not without preening itself, answered: “No, we manage differently; with us, that is with the rich farmer with whom we live, our future is secure. At harvest time, my mate and I sit up on the roof and watch. The farmer brings in so many loads of corn that I know we are secure for a very long time. We two are well provided for and have our guaranteed security.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stifling Laughter in Distant Places</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-cultures&#34;&gt;New Cultures&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first days of traveling usually involves laughing at the quaint and unusual customs of another culture.  That sounds close-minded, because in many cases it probably is.  But it&amp;rsquo;s something we all do, of course including yours truly.  Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a coping mechanism - laughing at things in the face of difficulties and differences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, we&amp;rsquo;re thinking creatures, and as such it&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard for us not to draw comparisons with our own home city and culture.  Especially when we spot things that we consider outdated in our own culture.  Our reaction may be disgust (&amp;ldquo;Fax machines?!  Didn&amp;rsquo;t those go extinct in the 90s?!&amp;rdquo;) or nostalgia (&amp;ldquo;Ahh decent customer service - it&amp;rsquo;s been way too long&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beginning thoughts on the idea of a Great American Road Trip</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of a trip across the United States has become somewhat of an American institution.  Something like a New American Dream, this one maybe a bit more accessible than that house, happy life, and nuclear family with 2.5 kids.  It&amp;rsquo;s something that is undertaken by both the young and the old, with the former perhaps hitchhiking or sleeping in their cars while the latter leapfrog between National Parks in their expensive and comfortable motor homes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many folks, including yours truly, have had an unpleasant night, and this morning a bitter awakening at the announcement that our new President will be Trump.  For most folks this comes as a shock, as we have all thought the chances of this happening were slim.  Comedians chided him on and dared him to run.  Even President Obama who continually roasted him &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mzJhvC-8E&#34;&gt;at the White House Correspondents&amp;rsquo; Dinner in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, arguably the defining moment when Trump became driven to run for President (&amp;ldquo;He certainly would bring some change to the White House&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;meta itemprop=&#34;mainEntityOfPage&#34; content=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I had the opportunity to attend my first philosophy class in about a decade.  The class was on the infamous philosopher Martin Heidegger, and the course was taught at Stanford University by Forrest Hartman (PHI 98: An Introduction to Martin Heidegger (Spring 2016)).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Heidegger is famous for being obscure and notoriously difficult to read, but I believe I made some headway in what turned out to be a very interesting philosophy.  Most interestingly, though Heidegger is considered to be a &amp;ldquo;continental&amp;rdquo; philosophy, I found some common ground with Quine, who is considered to be an &amp;ldquo;analytical&amp;rdquo; philosophy, supposedly in a diametrically opposed camp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We Americans believe we have a right to be the way we want to be, which includes being lazy physically and intellectually. Junk is more shiny and more entertaining than non-junk, after all, and we can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to be bored with non-junk.  We now have many forms of poison that we unwittingly ingest in various ways.  We have created in many ways our own version of the gladiator games that the masses celebrated through the downfall of Rome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yes, we are bored. We&amp;rsquo;re all bored now. But has it ever occurred to you, Wally, that the process that creates this boredom that we see in the world now may very well be a self-perpetuating, unconscious form of brainwashing, created by a world totalitarian government based on money, and that all of this is much more dangerous than one thinks?  And it&amp;rsquo;s not just a question of individual survival Wally, but that somebody who&amp;rsquo;s bored is asleep, and somebody who&amp;rsquo;s asleep will not say no?&lt;br&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRBZDmf1jSw&#34;&gt;My Dinner With Andre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These damn existential nights are the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m tired of wasting my nights distracting myself, so I stayed at work late and went to the gym even later, then left around 10:45pm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even while exercising I could feel me asking myself nagging questions.  Why am I working out?  What&amp;rsquo;s the goal?  What&amp;rsquo;s the point of keeping your body healthy if you don&amp;rsquo;t even know where you&amp;rsquo;re going?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are important questions, but not the right questions when I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood.  I thought exercise could keep some depression at bay, but it&amp;rsquo;s still there, and there it reappears at the most inconvenient times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous two photo posts I wanted to avoid this sort of heavy reflection New Year post.  But its time has finally come and it should be said, no matter how cheesy it may sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been living these last few years of my life as driftwood.  At least professionally.  I have all the makings of what should make me happy and successfully in my career, but it&amp;rsquo;s an illusion.  I am an imposter.  I am living a life as professional driftwood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Forms of Escapism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking lately that the fates of so many are motivated by, in a word, escapism. Including my own fate. These are folks whose lives seem quite different on first glance, but turn out to be similar. We can&amp;rsquo;t escape some of our basic human nature after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-preservationist&#34;&gt;The Preservationist&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are folks who, for lack of a better term, wish to preserve a &amp;ldquo;simpler time&amp;rdquo;. They are people such as Thoreau, who wanted a return to simpler times and aspired to self-sufficiency (or an approximation, in any case). They are folks such as the Amish, who saw no good in the coming changes, and decided to create an ideal society in the form of a living time capsule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is finally the end of my first week in Japanese language school here in Kyoto. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a long week, with the most studying I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done in my life. We&amp;rsquo;ve gone through nine chapters in a week, and just Friday received two more books for learning Kanji. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn our first 50 Kanji in a week, alongside the rest of our classes. I already know some words here and there, but for the most part, much of what we&amp;rsquo;ve just learned is a blur, which is forcing me to use almost all of my free time in running to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Modern philosophy technically starts with Descartes, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start, or to get re-acquainted with philosophy in general.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through the Discourse again, and have found it to be more interesting and relatable this time around (particularly about lessons learned while traveling, but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another post).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The life of your parents&#39; choosing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several times I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;the religion of your parents&amp;rsquo; choosing&amp;rdquo;, used to scoff at adherents to various religions, as if they had no intelligent choice in the matter of their own beliefs. As the thought goes, religious standing (or lack thereof) should be a personal matter, one to be decided rationally (yes, there is such a thing as rational faith; to say otherwise is to label all religious people as fideists, which is a mistake) by individuals, apart from their social group if possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New direction (Developer Blog to Blog)</title>

      <guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2012/new-direction-developer-blog-to-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve come to terms with the fact I need to try something new in my life - a true change in direction. I anticipate that this blog will take the same direction, so there will likely be less and less &amp;ldquo;developer&amp;rdquo; posts and more and more posts of me living this new path. (TLDR: unsubscribe now, probably!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why the change in direction? I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fun, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived a comfortable life where I really haven&amp;rsquo;t had to worry about money (yet), but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the hard way that buying &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t buy happiness. It&amp;rsquo;s trite and it&amp;rsquo;s something you always hear, but I guess it&amp;rsquo;s something you have to figure out for yourself, the hard way. I read Walden in high school and thought I&amp;rsquo;d learned from its lessons. But I re-read it recently and came away completely changed. I can get by with a lot less, and most importantly - with a more meaningful job that pays much less.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was posted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/sw0t2/why_is_philosophy_still_important/&#34;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt; recently, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d copy my response here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, just a quick introduction! There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of thought recently that philosophy is useless. The main arguments seem to be that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;science has replaced any need for philosophy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;philosophy is a useless subject to study in college&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the latter argument, I recently recorded my thoughts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://davidbcalhoun.com/b/2012-03-17-the-value-of-a-philosophy-degree.mp3&#34;&gt;and you can hear them here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(if you didn&amp;rsquo;t read the title - warning: rant&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as web development goes, I guess I could rant on and on about the generalities. Of all things ephemeral. The lust after money, gadgets, and other worthless material crap that we use to stuff inside our oversized houses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The startling creativity and in equal amounts the lack of creativity. The amount of amazing invention and the equal amount of copying and ripping off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Huge huge rant incoming, but all is not said and done, and much is open for debate of course. Counterpoints and criticisms are more than welcome in the comments. This is just my opinion based on my experience at this point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;self-worth-the-rich-man-and-the-poor-man&#34;&gt;Self-worth: the rich man and the poor man&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a long while there have been places in the world that view self-worth as largely tied to wealth.  No doubt there is more than just money, as even within the rich community there&amp;rsquo;s a distinction between the established rich and the &amp;ldquo;nouveau riche&amp;rdquo;, or the newly rich.  One is ranked higher than the other, but nonetheless the rich are themselves seen as being more important than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improving yourself as a programmer versus as a human being</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(OR &amp;ldquo;The Post In Which I Conflate Programming and Philosophy&amp;rdquo; OR &amp;ldquo;The Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Existentialist Crisis&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning to read Dmitry A. Soshnikov&amp;rsquo;s tweet:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/DmitrySoshnikov/status/39356492058607616&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://davidbcalhoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/two-programming-languages.png&#34; alt=&#34;Have one-two langs in which you are a master and know professionally, and in addition, consider alternative langs. Your experience will grow.&#34; width=&#34;661&#34; height=&#34;318&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-639&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this seems like good advice for aspiring programmers, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think what this means for those who will buy into this. Us programmers have a keen ability to sit and focus on problems for extended periods of time, usually to the detriment of everything else around us. From the perspective of &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo;, we might as well be sitting in a basement somewhere playing World of Warcraft. Sure, programming is more productive, profitable, and surely not brainless, but at the end of the day we could still only be sitting in a basement somewhere. What I mean to say here is that we&amp;rsquo;re not actually living our actual lives doing these things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
