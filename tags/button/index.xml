&lt;p>A button is something that seems to be made just for mobile: it’s designed to be big and easy to activate, as opposed to small and harder to activate, like normal text links. This seems ideal for a mobile devices, which have a small display area and whose form of input is a person’s (relatively) fat finger interacting with the screen. Contrast this with the desktop, where the display area is much larger and the input device, the mouse, is a much more highly refined and sensitive pointing device.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
