The eventual goal: to put together a sampling of the photos that stand out, sometimes for technical reasons, and sometimes for other reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year I sadly didn&amp;rsquo;t get out with the camera as much as I have in previous years, which made this post much easier (no excuses this year!). Less photos to sort through! And much easier to pick out a small representative sampling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My year in photos, part 2 (2014)</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-part-2-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2014 23:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-part-2-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was just putting together this article and these photos on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve when I glanced and the clock and noticed I was already four minutes into 2015.

&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the second-parter for my favorite photo from 2014. Also be sure to check out the &lt;a href="https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-2014/">first part&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yuka was still here in early July, just in time to see Fourth of July fireworks at Big Bear Lake, California, before she had to go back to Japan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Milky Way galaxyrise from Maui</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/milky-way-galaxyrise-from-maui/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2014 23:12:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/milky-way-galaxyrise-from-maui/</guid><description>&lt;figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center">

&lt;p>I was lucky enough to finally visit Hawaii with my parents. Being experts Hawaii tourists, they set us up in a nice traditional resort called The Mauian - a nice quiet(er) little place that has a time for &amp;ldquo;quiet hours&amp;rdquo; (apparently the other resorts are places to party).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got back to the hotel a little after quiet hours, and my folks mentioned that you could see the Milky Way quite clearly. Being Hawaii, and Maui at that, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of light pollution like we&amp;rsquo;re used to. I thought I better not miss the chance, and went and grabbed my 16-35mm f/2.8.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
