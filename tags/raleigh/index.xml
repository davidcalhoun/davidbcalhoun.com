      <description>&lt;p&gt;2023 has been a stressful and hard year, and I have a sneaking suspicion this is a preview of even harder years on my path ahead.  I am finding myself more tired and having really poor sleep quality, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I see things improving but I am cautiously optimisitic.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to keep positive by remembering my blessings as best I can, and this year came with a lot of blessings for sure.  This post I do yearly forces me to acknowledge those blessings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
