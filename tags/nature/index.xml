&lt;p>When my work contract ended in April, it was perfect timing for me to put my stuff into storage and attempt what I had been planning for at least a few years now: see how much of the &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail">Appalachian Trail (AT)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> I could hike - a sort of challenge for myself to see how far I could go before giving up mentally or physically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>11 mile Big Basin hike</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/11-mile-big-basin-hike/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2016 08:47:58 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/11-mile-big-basin-hike/</guid><description>&lt;figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center">

&lt;p>I really needed to get out of Silicon Valley again and go experience nature, so on Sunday I drove over to my favorite hiking spot, Big Basin. There&amp;rsquo;s a $10 fee to get in and park, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it considering it&amp;rsquo;s about the price of a movie and much more rewarding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I arrived right after the park opened and started my hike to Berry Creek Falls at 8:20am, which is probably the earliest I&amp;rsquo;ve started there. Today was a bit difficult because of the recent rains: much of the trail was very muddy, and I found myself stopping a few times to try to work out the best path through the mud.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Big Basin October Hike</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2015/big-basin-october-hike/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2015 01:34:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2015/big-basin-october-hike/</guid><description>&lt;figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center">

&lt;p>On Sunday I grabbed two sandwiches at Le Boulanger, and headed for a late hike in Big Basin, which is my favorite place to hike in the area. The drive from my apartment in Sunnyvale is almost an hour and a half, and the fee to park is $10, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it to go and spend time there once and a while.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
