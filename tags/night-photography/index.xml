&lt;p>This is the first of what I hope will be many. The assignment here is to try to capture the atmosphere of eastern Kyoto&amp;rsquo;s traditional streets at night.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of things I had to plan for: Kyoto is a bit far from my hostel in Osaka, so I made sure to make a day trip out of it. Also, I wanted preferably a somewhat rainy day, which would make the ground more reflective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Milky Way galaxyrise from Maui</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/milky-way-galaxyrise-from-maui/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2014 23:12:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/milky-way-galaxyrise-from-maui/</guid><description>&lt;figure itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="center">

&lt;p>I was lucky enough to finally visit Hawaii with my parents. Being experts Hawaii tourists, they set us up in a nice traditional resort called The Mauian - a nice quiet(er) little place that has a time for &amp;ldquo;quiet hours&amp;rdquo; (apparently the other resorts are places to party).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got back to the hotel a little after quiet hours, and my folks mentioned that you could see the Milky Way quite clearly. Being Hawaii, and Maui at that, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of light pollution like we&amp;rsquo;re used to. I thought I better not miss the chance, and went and grabbed my 16-35mm f/2.8.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
