A lot of these happen early on in childhood, but even so, I find that there are some lessons I am still learning to this day. I am trying to improve, trying to get better constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these childhood lessons for me was a year when my family was tight on money and was forced to combine Christmas with a mid-year back-to-school resupply. It was a really bitter pill for my sister and I to swallow. Most of our gifts were stationary items like bags of rubber bands, Post-Its, staplers and packs of staples, some of which I&amp;rsquo;m still finding unused in boxes to this day. I think we were told beforehand not to get our hopes up for that years&amp;rsquo; gifts, and that cash was tight. Knowing what to expect (or in this case what &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> to expect) helped soften the blow a bit, but it was still a huge challenge to receive these items gratefully. I vaguely remember trying the best I could to bottle my emotions, but it was difficult. It was impossible to convey at the time, but it was just one of many of life&amp;rsquo;s disappointments, something we had better get used to early on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
