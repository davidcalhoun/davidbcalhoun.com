The eventual goal: to put together a sampling of the photos that stand out, sometimes for technical reasons, and sometimes for other reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year I sadly didn&amp;rsquo;t get out with the camera as much as I have in previous years, which made this post much easier (no excuses this year!). Less photos to sort through! And much easier to pick out a small representative sampling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My year in photos (2016)</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/my-year-in-photos-2016/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2016 23:17:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2016/my-year-in-photos-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few years back I put together my favorite photos of the year (see it: &lt;a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-2014/">part one&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="//davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-2014-part-2/">part two&lt;/a>). I decided to resurrect the tradition, and I hope to keep it going in the coming years!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onto the pics!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I visited Yosemite twice, first by myself and later with my friend Kevin.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For this shot I drove to the empty Bridalveil Falls parking lot and placed an LED lantern in the middle of the parking lot, then shot straight up. I was super happy with the way this turned out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My year in photos, part 2 (2014)</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-part-2-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2014 23:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-part-2-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was just putting together this article and these photos on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve when I glanced and the clock and noticed I was already four minutes into 2015. Oops!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the second-parter for my favorite photo from 2014. Also be sure to check out the &lt;a href="https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-2014/">first part&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yuka was still here in early July, just in time to see Fourth of July fireworks at Big Bear Lake, California, before she had to go back to Japan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My year in photos, part 1 (2014)</title><link>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-part-1-2014/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2014 01:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/my-year-in-photos-part-1-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s nearing the year&amp;rsquo;s end, so of course this means a somewhat sentimental blog post from me. I was thinking of a &amp;ldquo;resolutions/goals&amp;rdquo; type post, but I decided against it. Instead here&amp;rsquo;s something more entertaining: my favorite photos from the past year! Note that these aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily my best, just my favorites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding these is also a little bit of housekeeping for me and my photos. It forces me to sort the gigabytes and gigabytes of RAW photos I was casually dumping onto drives the entire year.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
