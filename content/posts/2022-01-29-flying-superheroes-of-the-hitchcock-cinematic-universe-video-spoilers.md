Just expanding on a little silly idea I had.  What if I reversed a bunch of falling people from Hitchcock films and turned them into awkwardly flying superheroes?  Definitely works better in some than others.  Judge for yourself!

Possible spoiler alert for these movies:

* To Catch A Thief (1955)
* Vertigo (1958)
* Jamaica Inn (1939)
* The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934)
* Foreign Correspondent (1940)
* The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)
* Rear Window (1954)
* Saboteur (1942)
* North by Northwest (1959)
