(2016 note: this was a terrible idea because I'm neither a native speaker nor a good speaker in general..  but I'm leaving this up for posterity...)

I have been learning bits and pieces of Japanese throughout the years, and picking up more and more on each of my trips to Japan. But now it's time to buckle down and get disciplined about learning, and make some real progress.

As with learning any language, having a decent vocabulary is critical in order to form coherent sentences, so I've decided to focus on this for the time being, in addition to learning hiragana and katakana and getting it down pat, with no errors.

You may already be familiar with the JLPT, the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, which has difficulty ranges between 1-5, with 1 being the most difficult. So let's start together at JLPT 5.

Thanks to [this site][1], I've use the following first 50 vocabulary words and [recorded myself][2] going through them so I can commit these to memory (many I already know, which is a good thing I suppose!). Of course I will be speaking only to the best of my ability, so the pronunciation of many words will likely be off in some way or another. In any case, it should be useful to listen to on repeat to get these drilled into my head! I've uploaded my recording for your convenience, but note again that the pronunciation isn't perfect, and this is a free service, so don't complain.
