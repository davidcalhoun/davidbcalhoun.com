A while back I posted an [old video I made of Spring in Kyoto](https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2013/video-spring-in-kyoto-%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%98%A5/), but the audio track was removed by YouTube. So I'm self-hosting it here now, and reposting to revisit the memories!

I really enjoy the atmosphere in this video, and I wish I made more videos like them. I used my Canon 7D for a lot of the video, but I wish it was shot in RAW video and on a tripod, as a lot of the detail was lost and a lot of the video ended up "wobbly". There is also some software stabilization which looks pretty unnatural.

This video took a lot of work and kind of confirmed for me that videography is super hard to do well. Photography is more my speed, but it's fun to practice both. I hope for plenty more future practice!
