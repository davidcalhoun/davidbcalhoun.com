I'd been looking for a night like tonight for a long time, when the new moon fell squarely on the weekend.  The only problem: unpredictable weather!

I drive about an hour and a half south on the 101 and then the 25 to head towards the east Pinnacles entrance, which I'd never been at before.  I also chatted with Yuka over LINE for a bit of it, at least until the reception got bad and dropped the call about ten minutes beofre getting to the park.

In any case, I made past the folks camping nearby, to the wide open dirt parking lot.  I rolled down my window, and stuck my head out the window to look up at the sky.  Wait, what sky?  It turned out to be clouds.  100% clouds.

The forecast said it would be partly cloudy, which has sometimes meant 10% clouds whereas other times...  Well, I guess this fell into the "other times" category.

Just proves that you can't win them all, and you can't plan everything.  Sometimes you just have to travel a lot and occassionally get lucky.

Like the time the moon was rising straight over the road behind me on the way to my parents' house in Big Bear, but I didn't have my camera stuff ready in time.  That would've been an awesome shot, but now it's an awesome memory.

Or the time I drove up Whitney Portal Road to get a shot of [the snow-covered mountains that you could see visibly glowing under the moonlight](https://www.flickr.com/photos/franksvalli/13234418335).

Until next time!
