## Modern deterioration

At this point you'd think it would be undeniable that education is quite important to our formation. But why then is there so much undercutting and devaluation of it in our society? I think it has something to do with what our collective north star is, at least in America these days. Importantly, I think most of us subconsciously pick up this north start through our upbringing.

Many rightly question why students need to learn to play a musical instrument? Or philosophy? Or literature, or any other class not directly relevant to their first chosen career. And folks with good intention will defend these in terms of the career north star (for instance, philosophy grads tend to rank high on the LSAT, for folks with aspirations to become lawyers). And why do we celebrate when someone finds early success and drops out of school to pursue their career? As a society we applaud this, without realizing that perhaps we are created half-baked human beings.

But the real disconnect is the north star. Is the function of education to make sure to create workers (cogs in specific shapes that fit into an economic machine)? But I think we seriously need to take pause and re-evaluate. How is it that so many pivotal thinkers think it's rather a more crucial role, instrumental and in many ways locking-in not only certain ways of thinking, but also fundamentally setting into motion what sorts of things they will desire, and what things will and will not resonate with them in the future?

There are hints of this modern attitude manifested in many other ways, and it's helpful at each instant to ask what is their north star?

Some folks say we should focus our reading on nonfiction and spend less time - or no time - on useless nonfiction. Their north star is pure profit or career success. No time for understanding the human condition, which is a distraction to that path.

Or that if we have free time as programmers, we should spend our time learning a second programming language. Better to double down on career instead of making us a more balanced human being. No time to distract us on that career path.

Or that we should wake up at 4am and follow whatever routines some influencer has recommended. Or that we read the 10 books Bill Gates has recommended to us this year. But not because it's good in itself or even good for us as human beings, but that it enables us to reach a profitable end.

Or that some mindfulness or yoga is useful not in itself, but purely as an instrument to help in some path towards career success.

Now I don't wonder as much when I overhear conversations in American cafes, which always inevitably gravitate towards possessions and money. No wonder, because it's people's north star.

But what if the actual human condition, all those things that are distractions, are actually the important things?
