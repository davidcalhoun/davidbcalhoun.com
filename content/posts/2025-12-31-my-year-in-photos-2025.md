2025 was a crazy year for the world, but since we already know that, I'm not going to focus on that here.  The thing I have most control over is my own life and living it the best and fullest way I can.

This year I was motivated to travel a lot more after the death of my Grandfather (who passed away at the full age of 97) and also recently hearing of the untimely deaths of old coworkers.

A quick summary of this year's travels for my own reference for my future self:

* February
  * California Eastern Sierra trip with Mark (by air).  The very start of this trip is what turned out to be the last visit to Grandpa in LA.
  * Work trip to DC (by train)
* June
  * Connecticut work trip at Mohegan Sun (by air)
  * Ohio trip to see Matt and Mark (by air)
* July - South Carolina for the Fourth of July (by car)
* August
  * Vegas, Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam with Mark (by air)
  * Germany by myself (by air)
* September - LA funeral for Grandpa (by air)
* October - South Carolina for Dad's birthday (by car)
* November - Japan trip with Mark (by air)
* December - South Carolina for Christmas (by car)

And now for some of my favorite photos of the year...

I really missed driving around the Eastern Sierra - it was my great escape when I lived in the Bay Area.  I took a trip with Mark driving a rental car.  In the middle of winter, with snow chains and all.

Heidelberg was my favorite city in Germany.  Like any good city in the world, they have a river running through it and some great opportunities for walking.  I made a point of hiking the Philosophenweg (Philosopher's Way), which is the counterpart to the Philosopher's Path in Kyoto (哲学の道, side note - 道 has multiple connotations [path, way, road, etc] that makes the name really poetic).

Here's a video I made of the complete walk - no music or anything, just meant to be relaxing:

After a really tiring marathon of traveling, there was a brief rest... and then... off to Japan!

Japan again!  I am more than happy to visit again, although these days the main motivation is friend-focused.  This time time was to visit with my good friend Mark and also hang out with my good friend Yuka.

We were lucky to see Mount Fuji multiple times, from the Skytree, from Odaiba while walking around, and again when we were on the bullet train to Kyoto.
